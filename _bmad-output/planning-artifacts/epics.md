### NonFunctional Requirements

NFR1: The benchmark-verification and solution-revision loop shall complete in under 15 minutes at the 95th percentile for the standard Phase 1 benchmark suite.
NFR2: Static preview artifacts shall be available for 100% of benchmarks that produce render evidence before final proof artifacts are accepted.
NFR3: Benchmarks that do not declare a physics mode shall not trigger heavy physics, FEM, or fluid evaluation.
NFR4: Planning and review requests shall return an initial response within 2 seconds at the 95th percentile while heavy evaluation is pending.
NFR5: Repeated validation of the same unchanged revision shall produce 0 new heavy evaluations and shall return the previously persisted result or a no-op status.

NFR20: Backups shall restore persisted run metadata and artifact references with 100% integrity in periodic restore tests.
NFR21: Untrusted generated code shall not mutate persistent workflow state directly; all state changes shall be mediated by validated artifacts and recorded actions.
NFR22: Concurrent heavy evaluation requests for the same episode shall either start, return a deterministic busy status, or fail with a terminal reason within the request timeout.
NFR23: Benchmark-owned artifacts shall remain read-only during engineering runs, and engineer-owned outputs shall remain separate from benchmark context.
NFR24: 100% of accepted solutions shall include a final proof artifact that is distinct from any preview artifact.
NFR25: Validation, review, and export artifacts shall round-trip through storage and retrieval without loss of required fields or schema drift.

### Additional Requirements

- Controller/worker/Temporal split remains mandatory; generated code executes off the controller in isolated worker processes.
- Planner and reviewer handoffs are strict-schema artifacts with stage-specific manifests, no silent fallback, and fail-closed routing on stale, missing, or invalid artifacts.
- Planner-owned derived values such as cost caps are deterministic outputs of validator tooling, not freeform authoring.
- Benchmark-owned fixtures, electronics, and motion context are read-only unless the benchmark explicitly declares engineer interaction.
- Benchmark setup must preserve distinct benchmark-owned vs engineer-owned artifact boundaries and hash-based immutability across handoff.
- `/benchmark/validate` uses MuJoCo for static preview by default; Genesis parity is validated through dedicated simulation paths, not preview reruns.
- Static preview must persist RGB, depth, segmentation, and render manifests when enabled.
- Reviewer roles must inspect render media with `inspect_media(...)` when render evidence exists; text-only file listing is insufficient.
- Simulation and validation must emit durable artifacts, events, and lineage; `events.jsonl` is batch transport, while Postgres and Langfuse are query sources.
- Dataset generation must preserve seed, episode, and review lineage, exclude integration-test and corrupted windows, and support replayable exports.
- Electromechanical tasks require explicit circuit validation, power budgets, wire routing, wire tear handling, and electrical evidence surfaces.
- Fluids, deformables, and stress-aware tasks require Genesis-backed final validation and structured stress/fluid artifacts.
- The roadmap expands through gravity, actuators, FEM, fluids, and electronics, with each family split into simulation, benchmark-generation agents, and engineering agents.
- Steering is a late-stage cross-cutting capability over the agents, not a first-milestone feature, and belongs after the gravity baseline is defined.
- Supported workbenches and mechanisms are finite and explicit; unsupported mechanisms fail closed.
- The frontend is an evidence surface for session history, chat/trace inspection, CAD viewer, code viewer, simulation playback, and feedback, not the source of truth.
- Advanced FEM, fluids, and electronics visualization in the UI is deferred until after the MVP; the MVP UI only needs simple workflow control, inspection, and review actions.
- Live steering must preserve selection metadata for faces, parts, bodies, subassemblies, code ranges, file references, and media references in traces and prompt payloads.
- Codex debug mode uses workspace-relative paths, a local submission helper, and the same fail-closed workspace contract as runtime.
- Local CLI agent flexibility is an optional, non-exclusive development and eval-debug path; supported CLI backends may supply benchmark and engineering decisions only when they satisfy the same workspace, prompt, artifact, and fail-closed validation contracts as the controller-backed runtime.
- OpenAPI generation, strict schemas, and integration tests remain part of the repository contract and must stay in sync with controller behavior.
- No silent fallback or degraded-success paths: any fallback must be explicit, traceable, and machine-readable.

### UX Design Requirements

- No separate UX design specification was provided in the planning artifacts.
- Frontend requirements from `specs/frontend-specs.md` were treated as cross-check requirements and are captured in the additional requirements set.

## Epic List

The first five epics are platform foundations. The remaining epics are capability-family epics. The baseline family is simple rigid-body simulation with gravity enabled, using MuJoCo-style simulators or equivalents, and steering is intentionally late-stage.

### Epic 1: Benchmark Creation & Validation
Human operators can author benchmark packages, and the system rejects invalid benchmark definitions with explicit, deterministic reasons before acceptance. The baseline simple rigid-body simulation contract with gravity enabled is included here as a validation dependency, not as a separate epic.

### Epic 2: Human Solution Workflow
Human engineers can take an approved benchmark, run candidate solutions against it, inspect pass/fail evidence, and iterate after failure without rebuilding the benchmark.

Human operators can validate solutions against cost, weight, manufacturability, and allowed attachment/drilling constraints using real manufacturing and COTS data.

### Epic 4: Dataset Export & Replay
Researchers and companies can export completed runs as inspectable, reproducible dataset rows with traces, artifacts, lineage, and replayable failures.

### Epic 5: UI, Visualization, and Demo
Human operators can inspect runs, visualize CAD and simulation evidence, create benchmark drafts, accept or reject simple plan artifacts, resume sessions, and present the system through a browser UI. This is the simple workflow and evidence surface, not the advanced steerability surface.

### Epic 20: Steering & Control
Human operators can steer the active benchmark generator and engineering agents with selected CAD/code context and targeted corrections. This is the active control surface, not the read-only evidence surface.

### Epic 21: Market Fit & Hardening
Define the target market and harden the product for that market.

## Epic 1: Benchmark Creation & Validation
Human operators can author benchmark packages, and the system rejects invalid benchmark definitions with explicit, deterministic reasons before acceptance. The baseline simple rigid-body simulation contract with gravity enabled is included here as a validation dependency, not as a separate epic.

### Story 1.1: Benchmark Geometry and Objectives
As a human operator, I want to define benchmark goals, forbid zones, build zones, and runtime randomization so that the benchmark has a clear, bounded, solvable contract.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** valid geometry inputs
**When** the benchmark is validated
**Then** the system accepts only non-intersecting, in-bounds objective geometry
**And** the benchmark package preserves the declared goal, forbid, and build zones

**Given** runtime randomization values
**When** the benchmark is saved
**Then** those ranges are persisted and visible in the benchmark package

### Story 1.2: Benchmark-Owned Fixtures and Interaction Rules
As a human operator, I want to declare benchmark-owned fixtures and electronics with explicit interaction permissions so that benchmark context stays read-only for an engineer solving the benchmark unless interaction is explicitly allowed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** benchmark-owned fixtures or electronics
**When** they are declared
**Then** they remain read-only for the engineer by default

**Given** a fixture marked as interactable
**When** the benchmark is validated
**Then** the interaction surface is explicit and machine-readable

### Story 1.3: Solvability Validation and Fail-Closed Rejection
As a human operator, I want the system to validate solvability and reject invalid setups so that ambiguous, impossible, or unsupported benchmark definitions never enter the solution workflow.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** an invalid benchmark candidate
**When** validation runs
**Then** the system fails closed with an explicit reason code

**Given** obstructed goals, impossible geometry, or unsupported motion
**When** the preview or validation path runs
**Then** the benchmark is rejected rather than partially accepted

**Given** a benchmark that is technically valid but still not solvable logically
**When** the validation tool evaluates it
**Then** the tool rejects it explicitly

### Story 1.4: Handoff Artifacts, Versioning, and Reproducibility
As a human operator, I want validated benchmark artifacts and preview evidence persisted so that downstream solution workflows can consume a stable, inspectable benchmark package, and I want to have no questions about reproducibility of the experiment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a valid benchmark
**When** it is submitted
**Then** the required handoff artifacts, environment version, and manifest are persisted for the latest revision only

**Given** render evidence exists
**When** the benchmark is reviewed
**Then** the latest-revision preview artifacts are available for inspection and traceable in the episode record

**Given** the persisted benchmark package
**When** it is reloaded later
**Then** the environment version and artifact hashes make the experiment reproducible

### Story 1.5: Review Colleague Benchmarks for Solvability
As a human operator, I want to review a colleague's benchmark for solvability so that I can reject technically valid but logically unsolvable problems before they are handed to engineering.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a benchmark that passes schema and geometry checks but is logically unsolvable
**When** I review it
**Then** I can reject it explicitly

**Given** a benchmark that is solvable
**When** I review it
**Then** I can approve it for downstream solution work

## Epic 2: Human Solution Workflow
Human engineers can take an approved benchmark, work a solution against it, inspect pass/fail evidence, and iterate after failure. Human engineers can also review a colleague's solution for physical robustness under runtime jitter and reject flaky results.

### Story 2.1: Start Solution Episode from Approved Benchmark
As a human engineer, I want to start solution work from an approved benchmark so that I can solve against the same benchmark context that was validated.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** an approved benchmark revision
**When** solution work starts
**Then** the benchmark package and environment version are carried forward unchanged into the solution workspace

**Given** a simple rigid-body benchmark
**When** solution work starts
**Then** the solution is evaluated in physically correct rigid-body simulation and the outcome follows physical reality

**Given** an unapproved or stale benchmark revision
**When** I start solution work
**Then** the system blocks the episode with an explicit failure reason

### Story 2.2: Inspect Solution Evidence and Terminal Outcome
As a human engineer, I want to inspect simulation results, render evidence, and terminal reasons so that I know why a candidate solution passed or failed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a completed attempt
**When** I inspect the run
**Then** the system exposes the latest validation or simulation evidence and the terminal reason

**Given** render or video evidence exists
**When** I inspect the run
**Then** the latest-revision media is available and traceable

**Given** the attempt failed
**When** I inspect the outcome
**Then** the failure classification is explicit and not implied

### Story 2.3: Revise and Retry Against the Same Benchmark
As a human engineer, I want to revise a failed solution and try again against the same benchmark so that I can converge on a passing design without redefining the problem.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a failed solution
**When** I create a revision
**Then** the benchmark definition and environment version remain unchanged

**Given** a revised solution is submitted
**When** validation runs again
**Then** the new attempt is evaluated against the same benchmark contract

**Given** multiple solution revisions exist
**When** I inspect the episode
**Then** I can compare the outcomes of the revisions against the same benchmark package

### Story 2.4: Review Peer Solutions for Stability
As a human engineer, I want to review a colleague's solution under runtime jitter so that I can reject solutions that only work in a lucky run.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a solution has jittered evaluation results
**When** I review it
**Then** the system exposes pass/fail across the required variations

**Given** the solution is flaky or unstable
**When** I review it
**Then** I can reject it with an explicit reason

**Given** the solution is robust across the required jitter cases
**When** I review it
**Then** I can approve it for the next workflow stage

## Epic 3: Cost, Weight, and Manufacturability
Human operators can validate solutions against cost, weight, manufacturability, and allowed attachment/drilling constraints using real manufacturing and COTS data, and the system can prefer simpler valid designs over more complex ones when multiple candidates satisfy the same benchmark.

### Story 3.1: Configure Real Cost Inputs
As a human operator, I want to configure the prices used for costing from real manufacturing and catalog data so that the system evaluates designs with defensible price assumptions instead of invented numbers.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a cost sheet or catalog source with known part pricing
**When** I configure the costing inputs
**Then** the system stores the selected price assumptions for later validation

**Given** a missing or invalid price source
**When** the costing inputs are validated
**Then** the system rejects the configuration with an explicit reason

### Story 3.2: Evaluate Manufacturability at the Requested Quantity
As a human operator, I want the system to evaluate whether a solution is manufacturable at the requested production volume so that I can distinguish a prototype answer from a small-batch or mass-production answer.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a requested production quantity
**When** manufacturability is evaluated
**Then** the system separates setup cost from variable cost

**Given** a design that exceeds the allowed cost or weight envelope for the requested quantity
**When** validation runs
**Then** the solution is rejected with an explicit reason

**Given** multiple manufacturing methods are possible for the same part
**When** the system evaluates the design
**Then** the chosen method is the one that satisfies the requirements within the allowed envelope

### Story 3.3: Evaluate Weight, Size, Form Factor, and COTS
As a human operator, I want the system to evaluate weight, size, and form-factor constraints together, and include COTS parts in the cost and manufacturability result, so that the answer reflects what can actually be built.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a design that includes COTS parts
**When** the solution is priced and weighed
**Then** the catalog parts are included in the total cost and weight

**Given** a design that violates size, weight, or form-factor limits
**When** validation runs
**Then** the system rejects it with an explicit reason

**Given** a candidate part without a valid catalog or manufacturing reference
**When** the design is reviewed
**Then** the system flags the missing reference instead of assuming a price or weight

### Story 3.4: Prefer the Simpler Valid Solution
As a human operator, I want the system to identify unnecessary or unjustified degrees of freedom and flag over-actuated solutions during review so that I can prefer the valid candidate with fewer unnecessary moving parts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** two or more valid candidates for the same benchmark
**When** the system compares them
**Then** it prefers the candidate with fewer unnecessary degrees of freedom, actuators, and parts

**Given** a solution with unjustified extra movement
**When** I review it
**Then** I can reject it as over-actuated or unnecessarily complex

**Given** a solution whose movement is justified by the benchmark objective
**When** I review it
**Then** the system does not flag it as over-actuated merely because it moves

### Story 3.5: Represent Allowed Attachment and Drilling Points
As a human operator, I want the system to represent allowed attachment and drilling points in the benchmark setup so that CAD and manufacturability review can validate how the design may be connected or modified.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a benchmark with declared attachment or drilling points
**When** the benchmark package is reviewed
**Then** those points are persisted, visible, and tied to the latest revision

**Given** missing, conflicting, or unsupported attachment or drilling points
**When** validation runs
**Then** the system rejects or flags the benchmark with an explicit reason

**Given** a CAD revision changes attachment or drilling constraints
**When** the benchmark is reopened
**Then** the latest revision reflects the updated attachment and drilling rules in the review artifacts

## Epic 4: Dataset Export & Replay
Researchers and companies can export completed runs as inspectable, reproducible dataset rows with traces, artifacts, lineage, immutable run bundles, and replayable failures. Invalid or corrupted episodes are excluded at export time.

### Story 4.1: Persist Immutable Run and Release Bundles
As a human operator, I want validated benchmark artifacts, preview evidence, and immutable run or release manifests persisted so that downstream solution workflows can consume a stable, inspectable benchmark package and I have no questions about reproducibility of the experiment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a valid benchmark or official evaluation run
**When** it is persisted
**Then** the system stores the required manifest bundle, environment version, and revision identifiers for the latest revision only

**Given** the persisted bundle
**When** I inspect it later
**Then** I can trace the benchmark revision, solution revision, environment version, joinable session and episode identifiers, and preview evidence from the same bundle without relying on undocumented runtime state

**Given** render evidence exists
**When** the benchmark or run is archived
**Then** the latest-revision preview artifacts remain linked to the bundle and remain inspectable

### Story 4.2: Export Training-Ready Dataset Rows
As a dataset operator, I want completed benchmark and solution episodes exported as training-ready dataset rows so that I can use them for supervised training or RL.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a completed episode that passes schema, completeness, and lineage checks
**When** export runs
**Then** the row includes the source episode ID, revision hash, artifact hash, seed metadata, and required media or manifest artifacts

**Given** a row missing required metadata or with invalid lineage
**When** export runs
**Then** the row is excluded

**Given** a completed benchmark or solution row
**When** I inspect it later
**Then** I can recover the source benchmark, the solution, the review artifacts, and the joinable session and episode identifiers from persisted metadata alone

### Story 4.3: Replay Failed Episodes and Surface Deterministic Failures
As a maintainer, I want failed episodes to remain replayable from persisted artifacts and traces so that I can reproduce and diagnose failures without rerunning the original solver.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a failed episode
**When** replay mode loads it
**Then** the replay bundle reconstructs the failure state using persisted artifacts only

**Given** a terminal episode
**When** I inspect it
**Then** the terminal reason, failure classification, and explicit fallback or unsupported-feature mismatch are present

**Given** missing artifacts, stale manifests, unsupported mechanisms, invalid circuits, or missing review evidence
**When** replay runs
**Then** it fails closed with a concrete reason rather than a success state

### Story 4.4: Curate Seed Coverage and Exclude Corrupted Data
As a dataset operator, I want to manage coverage by seed and problem family so that the exported dataset stays balanced, representative, and free of known-corrupted rows.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** repeated seed variants or underrepresented families
**When** export prioritization runs
**Then** seed coverage is tracked through `seed_id`, `seed_dataset`, `seed_match_method`, `generation_kind`, and `parent_seed_id`

**Given** integration-test runs or known-corrupted windows
**When** export runs
**Then** those rows are excluded

**Given** different seeds for the same benchmark family
**When** I inspect the export
**Then** the dataset retains the seed lineage needed to reproduce the variation

## Epic 5: UI, Visualization, and Demo
Human operators can inspect session history, review traces and artifacts, visualize CAD, simulation, and circuit evidence, watch agent output in real time, interrupt active runs, and present completed runs through a browser UI.

### Story 5.1: Inspect Session History and Run Timeline
As a human operator, I want a session history and run timeline so that I can inspect the progress and outcome of benchmark and solution runs in one place.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a session
**When** I open it in the UI
**Then** I can see the episode history, status, terminal reason, and progress of the active or completed run

**Given** backend traces and tool calls exist
**When** I inspect the run
**Then** the UI renders those persisted records rather than fabricating placeholders

**Given** an interrupted run
**When** I reopen the session
**Then** I can resume from the last persisted state

**Given** context usage telemetry exists
**When** I inspect the run
**Then** the UI shows it

### Story 5.2: Visualize CAD and Simulation Evidence
As a human operator, I want to visualize CAD models, render evidence, and simulation playback so that I can verify the run visually rather than from text alone.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a completed episode with CAD assets
**When** I open the viewer
**Then** I can inspect the model and hide or isolate parts

**Given** simulation renders or video exist
**When** I open the run
**Then** I can play, pause, and scrub the evidence over time

**Given** latest-revision media exists
**When** I inspect the run
**Then** the UI binds the view to the latest revision rather than stale prior media

### Story 5.3: View Code and Artifacts
As a human operator, I want to view code, plans, and other files in the browser so that I can inspect the actual artifacts that produced the run.

As a human operator, I want wiring and power failure modes to be enforced so that electromechanical benchmarks remain physically meaningful.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a short circuit, open circuit, floating node, or overcurrent condition
**When** simulation runs
**Then** the run records a deterministic electrical failure reason

**Given** a wire route that violates the benchmark-defined physical path or gauge limits
**When** simulation runs
**Then** the run fails rather than allowing an invalid powered design

**Given** an electrical benchmark that would otherwise appear to pass
**When** the power state is invalid
**Then** the run is not classified as successful

### Story 17.3: Expose Schematic and Route Evidence
As a human operator, I want schematic and wire-route evidence visible in review so that I can inspect electrical failure reasons without reading raw solver output.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** an electromechanical run with electrical evidence
**When** I inspect the episode
**Then** I can view the schematic, routed wires, and failure classification associated with the latest revision

**Given** a powered benchmark review
**When** evidence is available
**Then** the review surface can distinguish circuit failure, routing failure, and power-gated motion failure

**Given** a final electromechanical result
**When** it is archived
**Then** the durable artifacts include the structured electrical result and review evidence

## Epic 18: Electronics: Benchmarks
Benchmark generator agents can ship electromechanical benchmark sets with valid circuit and wiring requirements and enough validation coverage for engineering intake, and the benchmarks describe powered behavior explicitly enough for engineers to work against them.

### Story 18.1: Generate Benchmarks Involving Electronics
As a human operator, I want benchmark generator agents to produce benchmark candidates involving electronics so that powered mechanisms have explicit circuit and wiring requirements rather than hidden assumptions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a prompt or seed involving electronics
**When** generation runs
**Then** the candidate declares the power supply, components, wire route, and powered motion contract explicitly

**Given** an unsupported circuit or wiring scenario
**When** generation runs
**Then** the candidate is rejected rather than silently adapted

**Given** a generated benchmark candidate
**When** it is reviewed
**Then** the electrical behavior is explicit enough for a human engineer to work against it

### Story 18.2: Produce a Representative Electronics Validation Set
As a human operator, I want a sufficiently broad electronics validation set so that engineers can work against meaningful electromechanical variations rather than a single toy case.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the electronics benchmark family
**When** seeds are generated
**Then** the set includes multiple variants across power supply, component family, wiring path, and load conditions

**Given** the validation set
**When** I inspect it
**Then** it is broad enough to exercise the benchmark generator against repeatable electromechanical cases

**Given** two benchmark variants are materially identical
**When** the set is curated
**Then** the duplicate is excluded or marked as redundant

### Story 18.3: Refine Electronics Benchmark Quality
As a human operator, I want benchmark generator output to improve based on reviewer feedback so that generated benchmarks involving electronics remain solvable, unambiguous, and suitable for engineering intake.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** reviewer feedback on a benchmark involving electronics
**When** the benchmark is regenerated
**Then** the next revision preserves the circuit and wiring contract and resolves the flagged issue

**Given** a technically valid but poor electronics benchmark
**When** review runs
**Then** it can be rejected as unsuitable for engineering intake

**Given** repeated electronics benchmark generations
**When** I inspect the run set
**Then** rejected examples are preserved for debugging and dataset analysis

### Story 18.4: Reliable Electronics Benchmark Output and Reviews
As a human operator, I want electronics benchmark output and benchmark reviews to be reliably good and explainable so that I can trust the AI without manually correcting most attempts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** 10 electronics benchmark generation attempts
**When** I review the outputs
**Then** at least 8 of the benchmarks are usable without me correcting the benchmark definition

**Given** an AI-generated electronics benchmark review
**When** I inspect it
**Then** the review explains the problem or acceptance reason clearly enough for a human to follow

**Given** an electronics benchmark review is unclear
**When** I read it
**Then** I can reject it as insufficiently explainable

## Epic 19: Electronics: Engineering
Engineering agents can solve electromechanical benchmarks with verified solutions that respect circuit validity, wiring constraints, and power-gated actuation.

### Story 19.1: Solve Benchmarks Involving Electronics
As a human operator, I want engineering agents to solve benchmarks involving electronics so that the system can produce a working solution for a powered mechanism.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** an approved benchmark involving electronics
**When** engineering runs
**Then** the agent produces a candidate solution against the same benchmark contract

**Given** an electromechanical solution attempt
**When** it is evaluated
**Then** the result is judged against the declared circuit, wiring, power, and physical envelope

**Given** the candidate solution fails
**When** the run terminates
**Then** the failure reason is explicit and the agent can continue from the same benchmark

### Story 19.2: Verify Electromechanical Solutions Under Load
As a human operator, I want electromechanical solutions to be verified under load and runtime jitter so that a passing solution is not just lucky or electrically unsafe.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a passing electromechanical solution
**When** the solution is reviewed
**Then** it respects circuit validity, power budget, wire routing, and benchmark-defined objectives

**Given** a solution that only works because the electrical behavior is unstable or lucky
**When** it is checked
**Then** it is rejected as flaky or physically implausible

**Given** a solution with a short circuit, open circuit, overcurrent, or invalid wire route
**When** the solution is evaluated
**Then** it is rejected as electrically unsafe or physically implausible

### Story 19.3: Persist Final Proof for Electromechanical Solutions
As a human operator, I want the final electromechanical solution proof and evidence persisted so that the solution can be inspected, exported, and reproduced later.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** an accepted electromechanical solution
**When** it is finalized
**Then** the final proof artifact is distinct from any preview artifact and is persisted with the episode

**Given** the solution evidence exists
**When** I inspect the episode later
**Then** I can review the exact schematic, wire-route, simulation, and terminal metadata used to accept the run

**Given** the electromechanical solution is revisited later
**When** the bundle is reloaded
**Then** the persisted artifacts are sufficient to reproduce the accepted result without rerunning the solver

### Story 19.4: Reliable Electromechanical Solution Output and Reviews
As a human operator, I want electromechanical solution output and solution reviews to be reliably good and explainable so that I can trust the AI without manually correcting most attempts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** 10 electromechanical solution attempts
**When** I review the outputs
**Then** at least 8 of the solutions are valid without me correcting the solution

**Given** an AI-generated electromechanical solution review
**When** I inspect it
**Then** the review explains the pass or fail decision clearly enough for a human to follow

**Given** an electromechanical solution review is unclear
**When** I read it
**Then** I can reject it as insufficiently explainable

## Epic 20: Steering & Control
Human operators can steer the active benchmark generator and engineering agents with selected CAD, code, file, or media context and targeted corrections, and the selected context is preserved in traces and prompt payloads. This is the advanced steerability surface, and it comes later because the agents have to be tuned to consume the richer context, not because the frontend interaction is fundamentally harder.

### Story 20.1: Attach Structured Context to Steering Prompts
As a human operator, I want to attach selected CAD parts, faces, subassemblies, code lines, file references, or media references to a steering prompt so that I can direct an agent with precise context.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a selected CAD entity, code span, file reference, or media reference
**When** I attach it to a steering prompt
**Then** the selected context is preserved in the prompt payload and trace metadata

**Given** multiple selected items
**When** I submit the steering prompt
**Then** the selected items remain distinct rather than being collapsed into an ambiguous blob

**Given** an invalid or stale selection
**When** I submit the steering prompt
**Then** the system rejects it with an explicit failure reason

### Story 20.2: Switch CAD Selection Mode
As a human operator, I want to switch CAD selection mode between faces, parts/bodies, and subassemblies so that I can select the exact geometry needed for steering.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a CAD model with selectable faces, parts/bodies, and subassemblies
**When** I switch selection mode
**Then** the UI lets me select that entity type distinctly

**Given** a selected CAD entity
**When** I attach it to a steering prompt
**Then** the selected entity and selection mode are preserved in the prompt payload and trace metadata

**Given** an unsupported or stale selection mode
**When** I switch modes
**Then** the system rejects it with an explicit failure reason

### Story 20.3: Apply Corrective Steering During Active Runs
As a human operator, I want to send corrective steering during an active run so that I can refine the agent's direction when I notice an incorrect assumption early.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** an active benchmark-generation or engineering run
**When** I submit a corrective steering prompt
**Then** the agent receives the selected context and the correction while the run is still active

**Given** a completed or terminal run
**When** I try to steer it
**Then** the system blocks the request rather than pretending that the run is still active

**Given** a steering correction changes the agent's direction
**When** the run continues
**Then** the resulting edits remain linked to the steering action in the trace

### Story 20.4: Preserve Steering Provenance
As a maintainer, I want steering context and resulting edits preserved so that I can debug the effect of steering and replay it later if needed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a steering action
**When** I inspect the episode later
**Then** I can see the original selection metadata, the steering prompt, and the resulting agent output

**Given** steering is used repeatedly in one episode
**When** I inspect the trace
**Then** each steering action remains attributable to the exact selected context and revision

**Given** no steering occurred
**When** I inspect the episode
**Then** the trace remains clean and does not synthesize fake steering events

## Epic 21: Market Fit & Hardening
Define the first target market and harden the product around that market so that the release has a clear customer profile, quality bar, and scope boundary.

### Story 21.1: Define the Target Market
As a product owner, I want to define the first target market and core use case so that product decisions are anchored to a concrete customer segment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the current product strategy
**When** market definition is completed
**Then** the target market, primary user type, and primary benchmark family are documented

**Given** competing market options
**When** a decision is made
**Then** the selected market is explicit and the unselected options are marked as out of scope

### Story 21.2: Translate Market Needs into Product Requirements
As a product owner, I want market-specific requirements to be translated into product constraints so that implementation work stays aligned to the chosen market.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the selected market
**When** product requirements are updated
**Then** the release scope, benchmark scope, and UI surface reflect the chosen market

**Given** a requested feature that does not serve the chosen market
**When** it is reviewed
**Then** it is deferred or rejected with an explicit rationale

### Story 21.3: Harden for Release
As a product owner, I want the product hardened for the chosen market so that the release is reliable, supportable, and ready for external use.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the target market and release scope
**When** hardening work is completed
**Then** the product has the required quality gates, observability, and operational constraints for that market

**Given** the release candidate
**When** it is reviewed
**Then** the system is judged against the market-specific quality bar rather than an abstract internal prototype bar
