## Objective of the system

We are to create a benchmark and a training dataset for evaluating LLM models on creating and solving dynamics problems.

### Outputs and end goals

1. Benchmarks and problems to solve
2. Reasoning traces trying to create benchmarks,
3. Reasoning traces trying to solve the problems with manufacturable and verified solutions
4. Solutions to the problems, with end goals of CAD models and manufacturable, verified solutions,
5. Notable optimization to the problems (found but not applied, by mistake or to save compute),
6. Skills acquired during execution of the model (SKILL.md files and their assets - references and scripts)
7. Journals and "scannable" summaries of the execution.
8. An open-source framework for benchmarking, optimization of visual-language models to solve dynamic mechanical engineering problems
9. **An open-source framework to solve mechanical engineering problems.**
