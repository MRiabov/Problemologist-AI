# Project roadmap

## Phase 1

We rollout two agents and an environment for: creating and solving dynamics problems.

What is solved? Moving objects from one place to another, given a budget (cost) and weight. That's it.

### Prerequisites

1. A simulator, "solver" capable of solving rigid-body movements, motors
2. A LLM agent capable of solving the problems
    - Creating the agent - prompts, tools, logic
    - Tuning the agent - make it be able to actually implement this.
3. The problems themselves
    - The problems themselves are generated by another agent
        - Create and tune the agent.
    - The problems need to be validated (i.e. be solvable)

Sounds basic, but it's quite a lot of code. Think - plumbing of the agents (tool calling, having the agent write code, etc.)

#### Tech stack

1. LLMs harness - LangChain (agent basics), LangGraph (agent extras), LangFuse (agent evaluation and obserability)
2. Worker and controller code - Python, FastAPI,
3. DB - PosgreSQL, SQLite for edge devices.
4. Networking and devops - docker-compose, Docker
5. Frontend (debugging mainly) - React, Vite
6. Deployment - Railway (cheap and easy)
7. LLMs technologies - SKILL.md framework (by Anthropic)
8. Test - pytest, vitest, Playwright.

## Extensions

The above is the "MVP" of the project. It's done first. I can, and probably should do it alone, because 90% of the work is plumbing the HTTP requests, tool calling, LangChain, etc.

### Work package 1 - Tuning the agent properly

Much work will be necessary to optimize and tune the agent. Prompt adjustment against benchmarks first and foremost. Subagent development (maybe).

#### Technology stack

1. Generic Pareto optimization <https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19457>
2. LangFuse - LLM eval framework

### Work package 2 - Fluids and deformable materials

Outside of adding just the standard rigid body simulator, add deformable bodies - that is, suitable for actual engineering, and likely fluids (fluids being both liquids and gases (gases unconfirmed)).

#### Technology stack

1. Switch the solver from MuJoCo (rigid, non-deformable bodies only) to Genesis physic sim.

### Work package 3 - Electronics

Train the model to do electrical engineering in 3d.

#### Work necessary

1. Do a customer elecronic solver or find one that would
2. Optimize the model to use electronics
3. Generate more training data.

At this point we'll almost definitely need a subagent. Although, it's actually easy to do (in fact, the MVP has multiple subagents) because of LangGraph.

#### Technology stack

1. A custom electronics solver! probably. I didn't find one that would suit 6-12 months ago. It's not a very complex thing - but needs to be done.

### Work package 4 - Topology optimization (extra cool)

This is definitely an extra, but adds a huge value to the project. Topology optimization:

"""
Topology optimization (TO) is a computational design method that maximizes structural performance by finding the best material layout within a given space, based on loads and constraints. By removing unnecessary material, it creates lightweight, often organic-looking, and efficient designs, heavily used in aerospace and automotive industries to minimize mass and improve strength
"""
Google it - it makes it very obvious. Essentially, it's optimization of engineering structures using AI to their peak performance (strength vs weight)
It's what every engineer wants to do, but doesn't always have time to do it.

#### Work necessary

1. Allow the LLMs new tools to make topology optimization
2. Generate a new dataset with topology-optimized parts
3. Again, tune the model to use topology optimization.
4. Possibly split the topology optimization to a more powerful CPU or even GPU machine because topology optimization is resource-intensive.

#### Technology stack

1. A topology optimization framework.

### Work package 5 - Productionizing

What can we make to make the actual engineers use this?

1. Improve the models iteratively do a lot of experiments,
2. Make the simulation engineering-grade.
3. Making a better interface.
