# Seed Artifact Reference Index

Use this index when creating or repairing seeded eval rows.
The same filename can appear in multiple stages, so always check the active role contract before editing.
When this index conflicts with the live validator, `config/prompts.yaml`, or the architecture docs, the live contract wins.
The acceptance-criteria files linked from this index should prefer `References` sections with markdown heading citations and code/function hooks. Treat integration tests as secondary checks only.

| `reviews/electronics-review-*.yaml` | electronics review | `electronics_review_yaml_acceptance_criteria.md` |
| `renders/**` | any role with visual inspection | `renders_acceptance_criteria.md` and `inspect_media(...)` on the latest revision's actual media |
| `scene.json` | benchmark coder, selected downstream seed workflows | Serialized scene snapshot that must match the authored source and evidence |
| `workbench_report.md` | execution-review flows | Short outcome summary consistent with validation/simulation |
| `role_input_index.md` | all roles | Per-role input bundles, conditional drafting companions, and current corpus row shapes |

## Canonical Validation Path

- `scripts/validate_eval_seed.py` is the first gate for seeded rows.
- It seeds the workspace through `evals/logic/workspace.py::seed_eval_workspace` and then runs `evals/logic/workspace.py::preflight_seeded_entry_contract`.
- The preflight path splits into:
  - `controller/agent/node_entry_validation.py::evaluate_node_entry_contract` for required state fields, required artifacts, and custom checks
  - `controller/agent/node_entry_validation.py::validate_seeded_workspace_handoff_artifacts` for file-specific semantic checks
- Tighten any file-specific reference against those code paths when a doc feels too generic.

## Reading Order

1. Open the artifact-specific reference for the file you are fixing.
2. Check the active role prompt and role-specific schema or validator.
3. Compare the seed row against the live validator output.
4. Repair the smallest source-level mismatch first.

## Default Failure Pattern

If a seed fails before LLM evaluation, it is usually one of these:

- wrong file set for the role
- stale revision evidence
- placeholder text left in a seeded file
- schema drift between planner handoff files
- missing visual inspection or review manifest
