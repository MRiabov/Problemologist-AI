# Problemologist-AI - Deployment Guide

**Date:** 2026-03-22

## Overview

Problemologist-AI runs in two practical modes:

1. A local development mode that starts the services with `scripts/env_up.sh`.
1. A containerized stack defined by `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.test.yaml`.

The local workflow is the main entry point for day-to-day backend engineering. The containerized stack is the closest thing to a production deployment shape and is the reference for service dependencies and ports. The frontend is optional for backend-only work.

## Prerequisites

| Tool             | Why It Is Needed                                               |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Python 3.12      | Runs the controller, workers, scripts, and tests               |
| `uv`             | Installs and runs the Python environment                       |
| Docker or Podman | Starts PostgreSQL, MinIO, Temporal, and the service containers |
| Node.js and npm  | Only needed when you are working on the frontend               |

## Local Development Deployment

### Start

```bash
./scripts/env_up.sh
```

This script:

- Stops any existing local environment first.
- Loads `.env` if present.
- Ensures Docker/VFS compatibility for constrained environments.
- Ensures `ngspice` is available for electronics validation.
- Starts the test infrastructure containers from `docker-compose.test.yaml`.
- Runs database migrations.
- Starts the controller, worker-light, worker-heavy, controller Temporal worker, and worker-heavy Temporal worker as local processes.
- Starts the frontend dev server on port `15173` if the port is free and the UI is needed.

### Stop

```bash
./scripts/env_down.sh
```

This script:

- Stops the local Python and optional frontend processes using the saved PID files.
- Kills any leftover Uvicorn or Temporal worker processes.
- Brings down the test infrastructure containers.
- Removes the local MinIO test volume so object-store state does not leak between runs.

## Containerized Stack

The root `docker-compose.yml` describes the full multi-service stack:

- `controller`
- `controller-worker`
- `worker-light`
- `worker-heavy`
- `worker-heavy-temporal`
- `postgres`
- `minio`
- `temporal`
- `temporal-ui`
- `migrations`
- `mock-warning`

The stack is configured for the controller to talk to the workers and Temporal over service names on the internal Docker network.

## Test Infrastructure Stack

`docker-compose.test.yaml` provides the infrastructure used by local development and integration tests:

- PostgreSQL
- MinIO
- Temporal
- Temporal UI
- `createbuckets` to seed the expected buckets in MinIO

This stack is intentionally smaller than the full compose file because the application processes themselves are launched locally by `env_up.sh`.

## Service Ports

## Health And Readiness

| Service      | Health Endpoint     | Behavior                                                       |

## Persistence And Runtime State

| Storage                   | Purpose                                                           |

| `logs/manual_run/`        | Local log bundle for `env_up.sh`                                  |
| `logs/archives/`          | Archived log bundles from previous runs                           |

## Deployment Notes

- The controller expects Temporal to be reachable before it starts serving traffic.
- `worker-heavy` uses off-screen rendering settings and `xvfb-run` in container mode.
- The controller and workers are designed to talk through their HTTP APIs, not through shared in-memory state.
- `worker-heavy` is single-flight by design, so a busy instance should be treated as temporarily unavailable rather than overloaded.
- `./scripts/run_integration_tests.sh` is the source of truth for integration orchestration; it archives prior `logs/integration_tests/` content into `logs/archives/run_*` and rewires the current-run symlinks for each invocation.
- If the local environment gets stuck on stale ports or unhealthy containers, run `./scripts/env_down.sh` before retrying the integration runner.
- If you change controller routes, regenerate the frontend OpenAPI client under `frontend/src/api/generated/`.

## Common Operational Commands

```bash
./scripts/env_up.sh
./scripts/env_down.sh
./scripts/run_integration_tests.sh
cd frontend && npm run build
```

## Deployment Checklist

1. Confirm `.env` contains the model and storage credentials you intend to use.
1. Start the environment with `./scripts/env_up.sh`.
1. Verify controller, worker-light, worker-heavy, PostgreSQL, MinIO, and Temporal are healthy.
1. Run the integration suite with `./scripts/run_integration_tests.sh`.
1. Check the frontend at `http://127.0.0.1:15173` only if you are working on the UI.
1. Review the logs in `logs/manual_run/` if any service fails to start.
