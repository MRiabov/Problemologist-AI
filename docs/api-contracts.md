# Problemologist-AI - API Contracts

**Date:** 2026-03-20

## Session and Authentication Conventions

| Convention | Details |
| -- | -- |
| Session header | Most worker and controller-to-worker calls use `X-Session-ID` |
| Worker filesystem bypass | Internal/system-only escape hatch; requires both a payload flag and `X-System-FS-Bypass: 1` |
| Backup protection | `/api/ops/backup` requires `X-Backup-Secret` |
| Controller compatibility | Controller routes are available both under `/api/...` and legacy unprefixed paths for backward compatibility |

## Controller API

## Worker-Light API

The `/fs` namespace is a shared workspace surface with three distinct
subfamilies:

- workspace CRUD and agent tooling
- low-level probes and raw-byte inspection
- explicit snapshot transport

Use the narrowest subfamily that matches the caller's intent. Integration tests
should not use raw probe calls as generic scaffolding when a batch upload or a
direct fixture seed would be clearer.

### Service Health

| -- | -- | -- |
| GET | `/health` | Health check |

### File Workspace Surface

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| -- | -- | -- |
| POST | `/fs/ls` | List files in the session filesystem |

| POST | `/fs/edit` | Apply replacements to a file |
| POST | `/fs/upload_file` | Upload a binary file |
| POST | `/fs/grep` | Search for text in files |
| POST | `/fs/delete` | Delete a file or directory |
| POST | `/fs/upload_files` | Upload multiple files in one request |
| POST | `/fs/read_files` | Read multiple files in one request |
| POST | `/fs/exists` | Check whether a path exists |
| POST | `/fs/read_blob` | Read raw bytes from a path |
| POST | `/fs/bundle` | Bundle the session workspace into a tarball |

### Git And Execution

| POST | `/runtime/execute` | Run a shell command in the session workspace |
| GET | `/assets/{path}` | Serve a workspace asset |
| POST | `/lint` | Lint Python code with Ruff |
| POST | `/topology/inspect` | Inspect a topology target in a script |

## Worker-Heavy API

| Method | Path | Purpose | Notable Behavior |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| GET | `/health` | Health check | Reports the API process health |
| GET | `/ready` | Admission readiness | Returns `503` and `WORKER_BUSY` when a heavy job is active |
| POST | `/benchmark/verify` | Batched runtime-randomization verification | Produces multi-run verification results |

## Representative Examples

### Benchmark Generation

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:18000/api/benchmark/generate \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Create a funnel benchmark that teaches gravity and collision handling",
    "max_cost": 45,
    "max_weight": 1200
  }'
```

### Worker-Light File Write

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:18001/fs/write \
  -H 'X-Session-ID: demo-session' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "path": "script.py",
    "content": "print(\"hello\")",
    "overwrite": true
  }'
```

### Worker-Heavy Validation

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:18002/benchmark/validate \
  -H 'X-Session-ID: demo-session' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "script_path": "script.py",
    "backend": "GENESIS"
  }'
```

## Common Error Codes

| Status | Meaning |
| -- | -- |
| 403 | Permission denied, read-only path violation, or missing backup secret |
| 404 | Missing file, asset, episode, or session |
| 422 | Invalid review frontmatter, refusal artifact, or malformed artifact payload |
| 503 | Heavy worker busy or temporary admission failure |
| 500 | Internal error, validation failure, or unsupported runtime state |

## Compatibility Notes

- The controller mounts the main route groups under both `/api/...` and the legacy unprefixed paths so older clients and integration tests keep working.
- `POST /api/test/episodes` and `/test/episodes` are only available when `IS_INTEGRATION_TEST=true`.
- `POST /api/agent/run` and `/agent/run` create a run directly, while the episode and benchmark routes are the preferred higher-level entry points for most workflows.
- `GET /ready` on worker-heavy is the admission gate for heavy compute work; a `503 WORKER_BUSY` response means the instance is already busy with another job.
