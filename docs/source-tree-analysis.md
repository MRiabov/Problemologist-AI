# Problemologist-AI - Source Tree Analysis

**Date:** 2026-03-20

## Overview

The repository is organized around a controller-led runtime with split worker services, a shared contract layer, and a React dashboard. The tree also contains supporting assets for evaluation, research, docs, and local development.

## Entry Points

| Entry Point | What It Starts |
| -- | -- |
| `controller/api/main.py` | Controller FastAPI app on port 8000 in containers and 18000 in local dev |
| `worker_light/app.py` | Worker-light FastAPI app on port 8001 in containers and 18001 in local dev |
| `worker_heavy/app.py` | Worker-heavy FastAPI app on port 8002 in containers and 18002 in local dev |
| `controller/temporal_worker.py` | Controller Temporal worker for durable orchestration |
| `worker_heavy/temporal_worker.py` | Heavy-worker Temporal worker for simulation and validation workflows |
| `frontend/src/main.tsx` | Vite entry point for the dashboard |
| `scripts/env_up.sh` | Local infrastructure and application bootstrap |
| `scripts/run_integration_tests.sh` | Canonical integration test runner |

## File Organization Patterns

| Pattern | Meaning |
| -- | -- |
| `api/routes/` | HTTP route groups, usually organized by product area |
| `agent/nodes/` | LangGraph node implementations for planner, coder, and reviewer roles |
| `agent/benchmark/` | Benchmark-generation graph, state, and benchmark-specific utilities |
| `shared/models/` | Strict Pydantic contracts used across services and frontend generation |
| `worker_heavy/workbenches/` | Manufacturing and pricing logic for CNC, injection molding, and 3D printing |
| `frontend/src/components/` | Reusable UI pieces, grouped by layout, workspace, visualization, and shared controls |
| `frontend/src/api/generated/` | OpenAPI-generated TypeScript client and models |

## Notes

The top-level `main.py` file is a legacy convenience shim rather than the canonical runtime entry point. The operational services are the controller and split worker apps.

The `website/` directory is separate from the core product runtime. It mirrors the published marketing site and does not participate in the agent workflows.
