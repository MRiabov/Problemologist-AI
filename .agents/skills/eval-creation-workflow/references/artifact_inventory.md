# Eval Artifact Inventory

Use this document when you need the full filename surface that can appear in seeded evals or eval-adjacent workspaces.
This is an inventory, not an acceptance-criteria doc. For any row marked "needs criteria", create a dedicated per-file reference from the fallback template and specialize it to the active validator.

## Scope

- Includes files that appear in current seeded workspaces.
- Includes files that are required or validated by the live runtime contract even if no seed currently uses them.
- Groups scenario-specific render assets by family instead of listing every image variant.
- Excludes incidental runtime noise such as `__pycache__/` and `*.pyc` from criteria work, even though those files can appear in working directories.

### Note on the engineer execution manifest name

The live runtime contract currently uses `.manifests/engineering_execution_handoff_manifest.json`.
Some older references still say `engineering_execution_review_manifest.json`; treat that wording as legacy and update references to the handoff name when writing new criteria.

## Runtime Noise and Exclusions

| Family | Example filenames or glob | Treatment |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Python bytecode cache | `*.pyc`, `__pycache__/` | Do not write criteria for these; treat them as incidental runtime noise. |
| Ad hoc local scratch files | `*.tmp`, editor swap files, manual notes not referenced by a role contract | Exclude from eval seeds. |

## Known Gaps

- `precise_path_definition.yaml` now has a dedicated criteria reference, and the workspace contract should stay aligned with it.
- Render history files (`render_index.jsonl`, `frames.jsonl`, `objects.parquet`, `preview_scene.json`) are covered by the broader render family doc, but they still deserve their own narrower docs if we want file-by-file coverage instead of one broad render reference.
- `benchmark.xml`, `solution.xml`, and `events.jsonl` still need dedicated criteria docs if we want every eval-visible file family to have its own reference.
- The git eval support files and prompt files are currently only covered by task prose, not per-file acceptance docs.
- The geometry export assets (`*.glb`, `*.obj`) need a criteria reference if you want explicit file-family coverage outside the render/rendering docs.
