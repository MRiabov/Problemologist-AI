# Commit Split Workflow (Manual Only)

Use this skill only when explicitly requested by name.
Do not auto-trigger for general git or commit tasks.

## Goal

Split the current git changes into small, reviewable groups, then commit each group separately with a message that makes the intent obvious later.

The goal is not to "commit everything quickly".
The goal is to produce a commit history that lets the reviewer answer:

- what changed in this commit
- why it changed
- which files belong together
- what is already done versus still pending

## Commit message naming rules

Use these prefixes when applicable:

- `(spec)`: for editing markdown spec files (especially spec-kitty files).
- `(refactor)`: internal refactors with no user-facing behavior change.
- `(debug)`: debugging and bug-fix work.
- `(test)`: test coverage additions/fixes.
- `(devops)`: infra/deployment config changes (Kubernetes, Vercel, etc.).

For user-facing UI/backend feature commits, do not prefix.

Examples:

- `(spec) Specified spec 025`
- `(spec) Planned for spec 025`
- `(refactor) Make webhook logic more modular`
- `(debug) Fix test failure in submission routing`

## Process

1. Inspect `git status`, identify any nested repositories/submodules, and split changes by intent/meaning.
2. Build a commit map before staging anything: group related hunks by behavior, feature, refactor, test, spec, or devops work.
3. Run `pre-commit run --all-files` once before the split sequence so hook-generated fixes, lint failures, and codegen issues are surfaced in a single turn.
4. If there is a nested repository or submodule, especially `skills/` as a separate git repository, commit that nested repository first. Do not start the root split while the nested repository is dirty, because root hooks such as `record-skills-revision` can fail on a dirty nested repository.
5. If a file contains multiple unrelated changes, split it by hunk instead of forcing the whole file into one commit.
6. Treat generated JSON and manifest churn as a first-class change group. If `record-skills-revision` or a similar hook rewrites `render_manifest.json`, review-manifest JSON, or other hook-owned JSON to match the new HEAD, keep that churn in a dedicated cleanup commit and stage it last so the remaining split does not keep going stale.
7. Stage and commit each logical group separately.
8. Give each commit a descriptive message that says what changed, not a generic placeholder.
9. If a change lives in a nested repo/submodule, commit that repo's change as part of the split instead of leaving it dirty.

Commit grouping rules:

- Group by intent, not by file count.
- Do not merge unrelated fixes into one "cleanup" commit.
- Keep tests with the behavior they verify when possible.
- Keep spec or docs updates separate when they describe the work rather than implement it.
- Generated JSON and manifest files are expected dirt in this repo. Do not ignore them, but do not let them fragment the split either: batch them by generator/hook, and when they are revision-tracking output, make them the final cleanup group rather than spreading them across behavioral commits.
- Do not skip markdown changes. If markdown files are present, include them in the relevant logical commit or a dedicated spec/doc commit.
- If a change set still reads as "and also" when described, it probably needs another split.

Commit message rules:

- Use the existing prefixes when they fit.
- Prefer short, concrete titles over broad summaries.
- Name the result or behavior, not the implementation mechanics.
- Make it easy to match a commit message back to the grouped files.

## Guardrails

- Do not stage throwaway scripts. Watch especially for names like:
  - `repro_*`
  - `debug_*`
  - `verify_*`
  - `check_*`
- The `skills/` directory is a nested repository, not a normal folder. If it is dirty, commit it first before splitting the parent repository.
- Do not leave submodule changes uncommitted if they are part of the current work. Treat them like any other logical change group and commit them in the nested repo before finalizing the parent repo.
- If found (especially at repo root), call them out to the user and suggest moving them to `/scripts/throwaway/`.

## Quality gate

Before committing, prefer running:

- `pre-commit run --all-files`

This avoids hook failures and auto-fixes formatting/lint issues up front.
It is especially important when hooks generate or rewrite JSON artifacts, because it reduces later `.git/index.lock` collisions from hooks that also invoke git while pre-commit is stashing or restoring files.

## Final response requirement

Always include the final commit names in the summary.
Also include a short mapping from each commit name to the change group it covered so the reviewer can tell what was done in each commit.
