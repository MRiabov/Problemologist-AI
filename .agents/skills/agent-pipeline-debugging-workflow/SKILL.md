# Agent Pipeline Debugging Workflow

Use this workflow to make failing agent evals pass with the smallest reproducible run.

Deterministic validation is not optional: if a value can be checked from structured inputs, validate it exactly on node entry and exit and hard-fail on mismatch.

## Non-negotiable rules

01. Never debug with multiple agents (`--agent all` is forbidden for triage).
02. Always reproduce with one agent and one task first (`--task-id`, `--limit 1`, `--concurrency 1`).
    - `run_evals.py` now supports multi-ID `--task-id` input (repeated flags, CSV, bracket list), but use that only after first-seed triage.
    - `--random` with `--limit N` can help widen follow-up runs so they do not keep hitting only the first eval row.
03. Run evals through `uv run dataset/evals/run_evals.py`.
04. Use standard `run_evals.py` startup (it already runs env setup); avoid separate `./scripts/env_up.sh` for normal eval triage.
05. If you hit devops/startup instability (ports, stale containers, unhealthy services), run `scripts/env_down.sh` first, then rerun `uv run dataset/evals/run_evals.py`; the eval runner will bring the environment back up automatically.
06. Fix root causes in prompts/code/environment; do not add permissive fallbacks that hide failures.
07. Validate fixes against intended architecture/business behavior, not just current implementation behavior.
08. Use subagents to view and triage from logs; else you'll fill up your context too quickly.
09. If you changed a contract surface (prompt/runtime/helper/validator), treat any earlier eval behavior as tainted evidence until you rerun under the corrected contract.
10. Respect the skill split:

- `skills/` is the runtime agent skill repo.
- `.codex/skills/` is the Codex-only overlay.
- Do not assume runtime agents inherit `.codex/skills/`.
- It is acceptable for Codex to inherit or reuse runtime-agent skills, but not the other way around.
- If a Codex-only skill appears in `skills/`, remove that drift to avoid confusing runtime agents.

11. Distinguish three end states clearly:

- `code bug`: controller/runtime/helper/validator/integration behavior is wrong.
- `prompt bug`: orchestration is healthy but the agent is being taught the wrong operational contract.
- `optimization gap`: prompt and code contracts are now correct, but the model still fails because solution quality/search is weak.

12. If contract-surface code changed, run the relevant integration test before spending more eval quota.
13. Before rerunning a costly eval after an authored-script or helper-contract change, do at least one cheap validity check first when possible (syntax/import/basic command).
14. When debugging prompts, default to judge mode with reviewer execution enabled (`--run-judge --run-reviewers-with-judge`) so reviewer checklists are populated after hard-check success; opt out only when reviewer execution is intentionally not needed.
15. For basic prompt debugging and other work that is not FEM, fluids, part breakage, Genesis-native stress reporting, dynamic wire/softbody behavior, or other backend-specific artifact behavior, use the MuJoCo default with `uv run dataset/evals/run_evals.py`. Switch to Genesis with `--full-sim` only when backend-specific fidelity work requires it.
16. Treat schema, enum, numeric, and derived-field mismatches as source bugs. Validate exact structured values on node entry and exit, and do not explain them away as model flakiness or patch them with fallback handling.

## Minimal run setup

1. Select one agent and one seed task (normally supplied by user/failure context):

```bash
AGENT=engineer_planner
TASK_ID=$(jq -r '.[0].id' "dataset/data/seed/role_based/${AGENT}.json")
echo "$AGENT $TASK_ID"
```

2. Run exactly that case:

```bash
uv run dataset/evals/run_evals.py \
  --agent "$AGENT" \
  --task-id "$TASK_ID" \
  --limit 1 \
  --concurrency 1 \
  --run-judge \
  --run-reviewers-with-judge \
  --log-level INFO
```

Use `--run-judge` without `--run-reviewers-with-judge` only when reviewer execution is intentionally out of scope for the triage step.

3. For richer trace output during triage, add:

```bash
--verbose --log-level DEBUG
```

4. When the failure involves authored scripts or helper/runtime code, do a cheap pre-eval validity check before the full rerun when possible:

```bash
uv run python -m py_compile path/to/file.py
```

or an import/basic execution probe inside the seeded workspace, depending on the contract.

## Canonical debug commands

- Preferred log-reading method:
  Use a subagent to inspect logs and return concise evidence (`cause`, `proof lines`, `next fix`), instead of raw full-log reads in the main agent context.

- Primary agent log location:
  Agent pipeline logs/traces are in `logs/manual_run/` (`controller.log`, `worker_light.log`, `worker_heavy.log`, `temporal_worker.log`). Agent-level orchestration traces are in `logs/manual_run/controller.log`.

- Distilled eval trace log:
  `uv run dataset/evals/run_evals.py` also writes `logs/evals/readable_agent_logs.log` and updates `logs/readable_agent_logs.log` symlink.
  Use this first when the goal is to quickly read agent reasoning/tool flow without structlog wrappers.
  Format is intentionally simple:

  - `agent_name | short_run_id | text`
  - `agent_name | short_run_id | TOOL tool_name key=value`
  - `agent_name | short_run_id | RESULT tool_name ...`
  - `agent_name | short_run_id | TOOL tool_name ERROR ...`
    The file is derived from persisted episode traces, not from raw structlog output, so it should not contain ANSI color codes, JSON escaping noise, or structlog brackets/symbols.
    If another eval run is active at the same time, treat the readable log as contested evidence until you rerun in isolated single-agent mode.

- Hard-check pass-rate helper output:
  `uv run dataset/evals/run_evals.py` now prints `Hard check pass rates:` at the end and writes `logs/evals/hard_check_pass_rates.yaml`.
  Use this to quickly verify which seeded eval IDs were run per agent and which configured reward `hard_checks` failed.
  YAML shape:

  - `<agent_name>.ran_cases: [seed-id, ...]`
  - `<agent_name>.hard_checks.<check_name>.pass_rate`
  - `<agent_name>.hard_checks.<check_name>.failed_seeds`

- List available task IDs for one agent:

```bash
jq -r '.[].id' dataset/data/seed/role_based/engineer_planner.json
```

- Multi-ID task filter syntax (post-triage widening):

```bash
# repeated flag form
uv run dataset/evals/run_evals.py --agent engineer_planner --task-id id-1 --task-id id-2

# comma-separated form
uv run dataset/evals/run_evals.py --agent engineer_planner --task-id id-1,id-2,id-3

# bracket-list form
uv run dataset/evals/run_evals.py --agent engineer_planner --task-id '[id-1,id-2,id-3]'
```

- Fast sidecar sanity check (single use case):

```bash
uv run dataset/evals/run_evals.py \
  --agent skill_agent \
  --task-id sk-001-sidecar-skill \
  --limit 1 \
  --concurrency 1
```

- Extract key failure lines from eval runner logs:

```bash
rg "eval_trigger_failed|controller_request_failed|eval_failed|eval_timeout|eval_failed_missing_traces|overall_summary" logs/evals/run_evals.log
```

- Read the distilled agent log first:

```bash
sed -n '1,200p' logs/evals/readable_agent_logs.log
```

- Inspect service logs for the same timestamp window:

```bash
tail -n 200 logs/manual_run/controller.log
tail -n 200 logs/manual_run/worker_light.log
tail -n 200 logs/manual_run/worker_heavy.log
tail -n 200 logs/manual_run/temporal_worker.log
```

## Contract-surface checklist

When an eval regression looks like contract drift, inspect all relevant surfaces before concluding it is "just a prompt issue":

1. prompt text and examples
2. runtime helper modules exposed to agents
3. loader/import behavior for authored scripts
4. controller validators and script-contract guards
5. schema/request descriptions shown to tools or APIs
6. template repos and sample agent files
7. mock transcripts / integration fixtures that may keep teaching the old contract
8. architecture specs and skills that should own the long-form instructions
9. deterministic validators, normalization helpers, and generated schemas/code that compute or check derived fields

## Iterative debug directive

When asked to debug pipeline failures, keep iterating this loop until pass (or a real blocker is found):

1. Reproduce on one agent + one task.
2. Classify the failure from logs.
3. Map observed behavior to expected behavior in specs.
4. Implement the smallest source-level fix.
5. Re-run the same single case.
6. After pass, widen one notch (`--limit 2` for the same agent).
7. If the widened run or adjacent seed is still failing, continue debugging there instead of stopping at the first green seed.
8. If the first seed passes cleanly, proactively run at least one adjacent eval for the same agent to check whether the fix generalizes or whether another prompt/code bug remains.
9. Keep expanding after each green eval until you either hit a failing adjacent eval, exhaust the meaningful nearby seed set for that agent, or run into quota/time constraints. A single green seed is evidence, not completion.

Quota guard:

- After the first clear behavior improvement on the target eval, stop and inspect before spending more reruns.
- If the run starts showing unusual infra behavior, controller health churn, or repeated non-informative retries, abort and keep the evidence instead of burning quota.
- If integration is green and the remaining failures are solution-quality failures under a correct contract, stop calling it a pipeline bug and record the remainder as optimization work.

## Triage classification

- Environment/bootstrap failure:
  `controller_unreachable`, `worker_unreachable`, dependency/import/startup errors.
- API/orchestration contract failure:
  `eval_trigger_failed`, wrong status transitions, bad request/response shape.
- Trace/flow integrity failure:
  `eval_failed_missing_traces`, missing required agent trace despite completion-like state.
- Timeout/stall failure:
  `eval_timeout`, repeated `RUNNING` without meaningful progress.
- Prompt/behavior failure:
  pipeline executes but artifacts are invalid/incomplete relative to requirements.
- Optimization gap:
  contracts are now correct and the pipeline is healthy, but the generated solution is still weak, unstable, or under-optimized.
- Architecture gap:
  current code path is over-complex, contradictory, or missing logic needed by intended behavior.

## Architecture and business alignment checks

Use these files as the contract hierarchy for decisions:

1. `specs/desired_architecture.md` (source-of-truth behavior)
2. `specs/business-usecase.md` (business-level success criteria)
3. `specs/integration-tests.md` (hard behavioral gates and INT mapping)
4. `specs/dataset-generation.md` (seed lineage, batch/eval intent)

If integration expectations and architecture text conflict, document the inconsistency and fix toward the intended product behavior, not accidental implementation quirks.

## Prompt vs code vs environment decision rule

- Fix environment when services or dependencies fail before agent logic runs.
- Fix code/orchestration when state transitions, contracts, or trace semantics are wrong.
- Fix prompts when orchestration is healthy but outputs are consistently low-quality or malformed.
- Classify as optimization work when prompt/code contracts are already correct and the remaining failure is poor search, geometry choice, parameter tuning, or weak iterative improvement.
- If success requires fallback-heavy behavior, the source bug is still unresolved.
- If a structured value is deterministically wrong, fix the producer or validator; do not treat it as prompt quality or accept fallback parsing.

Prompt vs skill guidance:

- Stable operational instructions belong in runtime-loaded skills whenever possible.
- Prompts should point to the relevant skill and keep only task-local constraints, role intent, and the minimum contract reminders needed for correctness.
- If you find yourself repeatedly stuffing execution workflow details into prompts, that is usually a signal to move them into a skill.
- Keep the skill boundary clean:
  - runtime-agent skills belong in `skills/`
  - Codex-only debugging/editorial skills belong in `.codex/skills/`
  - do not copy `.codex`-only skills such as spec-authoring/editorial helpers into `skills/`

Import-side-effect hazard:

- If the new intended contract moves helper calls into module body, verify the heavy/light runtime can import authored scripts without recursively triggering validation, simulation, or submission during control-plane load.
- Check loader behavior and helper import guards before declaring the contract change complete.

Cheap validity checks:

- Prefer a fast syntax/import/basic-execution check before a full eval rerun when the changed surface makes that possible.
- Examples:
  - `uv run python -m py_compile ...` for Python control-plane/runtime files
  - importing the authored script in the seeded workspace
  - one direct validate/simulate probe if the contract allows it
- If the failure might be an invalid seeded eval rather than a pipeline bug, run:
  `uv run scripts/validate_eval_seed.py --agent <agent> --task-id <task-id>`
- This applies to any coder/debug flow, not only benchmark CAD tasks.

## Validation checklist before finishing

- Target run passes with one agent, one task, `--limit 1`, `--concurrency 1`.
- Relevant logs in `logs/manual_run/` and `logs/evals/run_evals.log` are consistent with a clean pass.
- Fix aligns with `desired_architecture` and business use case.
- No permissive fallback introduced to mask failures.
- If contract-surface code changed, the relevant integration test passes before you conclude the pipeline fix is complete.
- At least one adjacent case for the same agent passes (`--limit 2` or another explicit `--task-id`).
- If the target seed passes but an adjacent seed fails, continue triage on that adjacent failure instead of concluding the workflow is complete.
- Derived values, enums, and numeric constraints in logs and artifacts match the deterministic source of truth.
