# Publication Shape Repository Pruning Migration

<!-- Investigation doc. No behavior change yet. -->

## Purpose

This migration defines the conference-submission shape of Problemologist-AI.
The target is the smallest source bundle that still reproduces the paper's
benchmark-generation, engineer-solution, simulation, render-evidence, and
paper-figure claims from a clean checkout.

The source of truth for the full runtime remains
`specs/desired_architecture.md` and the architecture files beneath
`specs/architecture/`. This migration only answers what belongs in the
submission bundle, what is development-only bulk, and what is claim-driven
retained surface.

The rule is simple: if the final camera-ready paper does not cite a capability
as part of the evaluated result set, the capability does not belong in the
publication bundle. Future work, debugging convenience, maintenance helpers,
compatibility shims, and duplicate presentation surfaces are not publication
worthy.

The hard cutoff is Epic 7 in `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md`.
Anything whose first meaningful claim appears in Epic 8 or later is
out-of-bundle for the conference submission, even if the repository currently
implements it, documents it, or tests it. That includes the technical-drawing
contract, the electromechanical stack, fluids/FEM/stress branches, steerability,
and advanced UI visualization.

## Publication Boundary

The paper claims a dual-agent system with the following core surfaces:

| Claim | Core surfaces that must survive |
| -- | -- |
| Benchmark generation and review | `controller/agent/benchmark/**`, `controller/agent/nodes/{planner.py,coder.py,plan_reviewer.py}`, `shared/assets/template_repos/benchmark_generator/**`, paper-critical benchmark seeds and handoff fixtures |
| Engineering solution and review | `controller/agent/nodes/{engineer_planner.py,engineer_coder.py,engineer_execution_reviewer.py}`, `worker_heavy/workbenches/**`, `worker_heavy/utils/{dfm.py,verification.py,validation.py,payload_trajectory_validation.py}`, `shared/assets/template_repos/engineer/**` |
| Simulation and render evidence | `worker_heavy/simulation/**`, `worker_heavy/utils/{preview.py,rendering.py}`, `worker_renderer/utils/{rendering.py,build123d_rendering.py}`, `shared/rendering/**`, `shared/simulation/**` |
| Manufacturing and cost/weight checks | `worker_heavy/workbenches/**`, `config/manufacturing_config.yaml`, `worker_heavy/utils/dfm.py` |
| Prompt and skill source | `config/{prompts.yaml,agents_config.yaml,skills_config.yaml}`, `.agents/skills/**`, `shared/skills/**`, `controller/agent/prompt_manager.py` |
| Out-of-bundle by Epic 7 cutoff | technical-drawing contract, electronics/electromechanics, fluids/deformables/FEM, steerability, advanced UI visualization, and any helper or reviewer surface whose first real claim starts in Epic 8 or later |

Anything outside that matrix is excluded by default.

The publication bundle does not keep a dormant copy of later-epic features.
If a feature is removed by this migration, its prompts, config branches, seed
rows, validation helpers, runtime routes, and telemetry collapse with it.

## What Is Not Worth Including

The conference bundle must not ship the following feature families unless the
final paper explicitly uses them as evaluated claims:

01. The secondary operator UI and its generated client bundle.
02. The standalone marketing website mirror.
03. Duplicate paper drafts, compiled exports, and document logs.
04. Experimental performance probes and syntax-check harnesses.
05. Legacy compatibility mirrors and generic wrapper scripts.
06. Skill-training autopilots, journalling compressors, and promotion loops.
07. Steerability, drafting, and other internal tuning services.
08. Long-tail observability events that only exist for debugging or training.
09. Generated dataset corpora and non-paper seed families.
10. Broad frontend, eval, and integration coverage that is not paper-critical.
11. Later-epic physics and product branches, including electronics,
    fluids/FEM, technical drawing, and advanced visualization.
12. Internal documentation that explains the development tree rather than the
    conference artifact.
13. The technical-drawing contract, drafting-mode gates, and display-only
    companion scripts.
14. Any agent, helper, or test family whose only real claim is Epic 8 or later
    in `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md`.

## Feature Removal Matrix

### Presentation surfaces

`frontend/` is operator-facing, not paper-facing. The paper claims the backend
runtime and the evidence it emits, not the dashboard.

Trim the entire tree:

- `frontend/components.json`
- `frontend/eslint.config.js`
- `frontend/vitest.config.ts`
- `frontend/vite.config.ts`
- `frontend/package.json`
- `frontend/package-lock.json`
- `frontend/tailwind.config.js`
- `frontend/postcss.config.js`
- `frontend/index.html`
- `frontend/openapi.json`
- `frontend/README.md`
- `frontend/public/favicon.svg`
- `frontend/src/App.tsx`
- `frontend/src/App.css`
- `frontend/src/index.css`
- `frontend/src/main.tsx`
- `frontend/src/context/**`
- `frontend/src/components/layout/**`
- `frontend/src/components/workspace/**`
- `frontend/src/components/visualization/**`
- `frontend/src/components/Chat/**`
- `frontend/src/components/ui/**`
- `frontend/src/pages/**`
- `frontend/src/api/**`
- `frontend/src/lib/**`
- `frontend/src/test/**`
- `frontend/src/assets/**`

The generated TypeScript client and UI-only pages are especially unworthy of
publication inclusion because they exist only to make the dashboard pleasant
to use.

`website/` is a static marketing mirror. It does not participate in the agent
workflow and must be excluded wholesale:

- `website/**`

### Paper artifact duplicates

The academic-submission tree should collapse to one canonical paper source and
the minimal reproducibility inputs that the final paper actually cites.

Keep:

- `docs/academic-submission/final-project-report.tex`
- `docs/academic-submission/paper_benchmark/benchmark_definition.yaml`
- `docs/academic-submission/paper_benchmark/render_figure.py`
- `docs/academic-submission/paper_benchmark/scene_spec.py`
- `docs/academic-submission/paper_benchmark/script.py`

Remove or archive:

- `docs/academic-submission/Foundations of AI - Final Project Report.md`
- `docs/academic-submission/final_project_report.md`
- `docs/academic-submission/final_project_report.pdf`
- `docs/academic-submission/final_project_report.log`
- `docs/academic-submission/Problemologist_AI_Research_Matrix.md`
- `docs/academic-submission/Problemologist_AI_Research_Matrix.odt`
- `docs/academic-submission/export_report.sh`
- `docs/academic-submission/render_sources/README.md`
- `docs/academic-submission/IEEEtranBST2.zip`

If the matrix or render-source notes are still useful internally, they stay in
development history, not in the publication bundle.

### Experimental and probe surfaces

`scripts/experiments/**` is measurement and investigation bulk. It is useful
for maintaining the project, but it is not part of the paper artifact.

Trim the entire tree, including the named probes and their result archives:

- `scripts/experiments/performance/integration-cache-path-stability/**`
- `scripts/experiments/performance/no-compile-experiment/**`
- `scripts/experiments/performance/genesis-scene-reuse/**`
- `scripts/experiments/performance/mujoco-vs-genesis-prerender/**`
- `scripts/experiments/performance/renderer-parallel-modalities/**`
- `scripts/experiments/performance/payload-rotation-envelope-pruning/**`
- `scripts/experiments/performance/simulate-subprocess-reuse/**`
- `scripts/experiments/syntax/**`

The probe entrypoints are not publication-worthy:

- `benchmark_integration_cache_path_stability.py`
- `benchmark_compile_kernels.py`
- `benchmark_same_vs_different_scenes.py`
- `benchmark_randomized_intersection_boxes.py`
- `benchmark_validate_prerender_backends.py`
- `benchmark_parallel_modalities.py`
- `benchmark_fresh_vs_warm_simulate_subprocess.py`
- `probe_dspy_tool_syntax.py`
- `compare_dspy_react_vs_native_tools.py`
- `probe_eval_display_env.py`
- `probe_build123d_construction_signature.py`
- `probe_renderer_launchability.py`

### Legacy compatibility and mirror layers

The publication bundle should not ship compatibility mirrors that exist only
to paper over earlier layouts.

Remove or collapse the following surfaces:

- `worker_light/agent_files/**`
- `controller/agent/mock_llm.py`
- `controller/agent/mock_scenarios.py`
- `controller/agent/provider_tool_call_adapters/minimax_adapter.py`
- `controller/agent/benchmark/render_seed.py`
- `controller/graph/steerability_node.py`
- `controller/api/routes/steerability.py`
- `controller/services/steerability/**`
- `controller/persistence/steering_memory.py`

The generic shell wrappers are also legacy-only and should be trimmed in favor
of the stage-specific launchers:

- `shared/agent_templates/codex/scripts/submit_plan.sh`
- `shared/agent_templates/codex/scripts/submit_for_review.sh`

The stage-specific helpers stay canonical; the generic wrappers are the bulk.

### Technical-drawing contract plumbing

The technical-drawing contract is not publication-worthy for this submission
and should be removed end-to-end rather than left dormant behind `off` mode.
The trim needs to hit the runtime helpers, the config gates, the prompt text,
the seed materializers, and the preview renderer together.

Remove the drafting-mode surface and its helper functions:

- `shared/agents/config.py`
  - `DraftingMode`
  - `technical_drawing_mode`
  - `get_technical_drawing_mode()`
  - `get_drafting_mode()`
- `shared/script_contracts.py`
  - `BENCHMARK_PLAN_TECHNICAL_DRAWING_SCRIPT_PATH`
  - `SOLUTION_PLAN_TECHNICAL_DRAWING_SCRIPT_PATH`
  - `technical_drawing_script_path_for_agent()`
  - `drafting_script_paths_for_agent()`
  - `drafting_render_manifest_path_for_agent()`
  - `planner_role_for_drafting_script_path()`
- `shared/utils/agent/__init__.py`
  - `render_technical_drawing()`
  - `preview_drawing()`
- `worker_heavy/utils/preview.py`
  - `render_technical_drawing()`
- `worker_heavy/utils/handover.py`
  - `_drafting_mode_for_reviewer_stage()`
  - the drafting manifest validation branch inside `submit_for_review()`
- `worker_heavy/utils/file_validation.py`
  - `_technical_drawing_mode_for_node()`
  - `_technical_drawing_script_imports_and_calls_technical_drawing()`
  - `validate_drafting_preview_manifest()`
- `worker_renderer/api/routes.py`
  - the drafting preview route binding for `render_technical_drawing_preview`
- `worker_renderer/utils/technical_drawing.py`
  - `_drafting_preview_views()`
  - `render_technical_drawing_preview()`
  - `technical_drawing_preview_rendered`
  - `technical_drawing_preview_object_store_upload_failed`
- `shared/eval_artifacts.py`
  - `_technical_drawing_mode_active()`
  - `_agent_technical_drawing_modes()`
- `dataset/evals/materialize_seed_workspace.py`
  - `_filter_rows_by_technical_drawing_mode()`
- `dataset/evals/run_e2e_seed.py`
  - the `technical_drawing_mode` seed injection path
- `config/agents_config.yaml`
  - `technical_drawing_mode` entries
  - `render_technical_drawing` tool exposure
- `config/prompts.yaml`
  - all drafting-mode prompt appendices
  - all `render_technical_drawing()` instructions
- `shared/agent_templates/__init__.py`
  - benchmark and engineering template entries that point at drafting scripts
- `shared/agent_templates/codex/scripts/submit_plan.py`
  - drafting-mode role detection and submission gating

Remove the drafting fixture families and any seed rows that only exist to
materialize or validate technical drawing mode:

- `dataset/data/seed/artifacts/**/benchmark_plan_technical_drawing_script.py`
- `dataset/data/seed/artifacts/**/solution_plan_technical_drawing_script.py`
- any `dataset/data/seed/role_based/*.json` row with `technical_drawing_mode`
  other than `off`
- any `todo.md`, `journal.md`, or manifest entry that only exists because the
  drawing companion script exists

### Training, journalling, and skill-loop surfaces

The paper may claim skills as a concept, but it does not need the standalone
training machinery that manufactures skills or compresses runs after the fact.

Trim the following helper nodes and CLIs unless the final paper explicitly
reports them as a result:

- `controller/agent/nodes/summarizer.py`
- `controller/agent/nodes/skills.py`
- `dataset/evals/train_skills.py`
- `dataset/evals/eval_seed_update_autopilot.py`
- `dataset/evals/run_e2e_seed.py`

If the reward table is not cited in the final submission, the reward config
and loader should also be treated as internal-only:

- `controller/agent/reward.py`
- `config/reward_config.yaml`

The publication bundle should keep the skill source and prompt source only,
not the recursive self-improvement loop that edits them.

### Observability long tail

The paper needs observability for traces, review decisions, and reproducible
debugging. It does not need every low-level telemetry family ever added to the
project.

Keep the core event families that support the paper claims, and drop the long
tail of maintenance-only telemetry models from `shared/observability/schemas.py`
and the matching controller-side emitters.

Examples of event classes that should be removed unless the final paper
explicitly reports them:

- `LsFilesToolEvent`
- `GrepToolEvent`
- `ReadFileToolEvent`
- `WriteFileToolEvent`
- `EditFileToolEvent`
- `RunCommandToolEvent`
- `GitInitToolEvent`
- `GitCommitToolEvent`
- `SkillEditEvent`
- `SkillReadEvent`
- `SkillSelfReflectionEvent`
- `SkillUpdateEvent`
- `SkillPromotionEvent`
- `LibraryUsageEvent`
- `SimulationInstabilityEvent`
- `LintFailureCodeEvent`
- `LintFailureDocsEvent`
- `LogicFailureEvent`

The publication bundle should preserve the paper-relevant events such as
tool invocation, manufacturability checks, simulation request/result, review
decision, render request/inspection, conversation-length compaction, and the
paper-critical event families that prove the published claims.

### Dataset and eval bulk

The dataset should not mirror every historical row. It should keep only the
curated publication slice that matches the claim matrix.

Remove the generated corpora:

- `dataset/data/generated/**`

Trim the seed families that only exist for non-paper helper roles or old
compatibility names:

- `dataset/data/seed/role_based/git_agent.json`
- `dataset/data/seed/role_based/skill_agent.json`
- `dataset/data/seed/role_based/engineer_reviewer.json`
- `dataset/data/seed/artifacts/git_agent/**`
- `dataset/data/seed/artifacts/skill_agent/**`

If the final paper does not cite a role family, its seed rows do not belong in
the release bundle.

The evaluation and materialization helpers should be reduced to the minimum
paper-critical path:

- keep one canonical eval runner only if the paper needs it for reproduction
- drop the standalone autopilot, replay, and skill-training CLIs
- do not ship generated training artifacts as source

### Test and fixture bulk

The publication bundle should retain only the integration slices that prove
the paper's claims. Broad frontend, eval, and auxiliary integration coverage
is not worthy of inclusion unless the paper cites it directly.

Remove:

- `tests/integration/frontend/**`
- `tests/electronics/test_integration_electronics.py`
- `tests/integration/evals_p2/**`
- the non-paper subset of `tests/integration/architecture_p1/**`
- the non-paper subset of `tests/integration/mock_responses/**`
- `tests/README.md`

The `drawing-*` benchmark and engineer fixture families are also out of
bundle, because they only exist to exercise the technical-drawing contract that
this migration removes.

Retain only the paper-critical integration coverage, such as the benchmark
workflow, engineering loop, handover validation, render validation, COTS
geometry import, observability, infrastructure, and manufacturing slices.

### Late-epic branches to cut

The publication bundle stops at Epic 7. Any branch whose first meaningful
claim appears in Epic 8 or later is removed wholesale. Do not keep partial
branches, dormant config flags, or compatibility aliases for those families.

The technical-drawing contract is already trimmed in the section above. The
remaining late-epic families that must disappear are electromechanics, fluids
and FEM, steerability, and advanced visualization.

#### Electronics and electromechanics

Remove the entire electromechanical stack rather than trying to preserve a
minimal EDA subset:

- `controller/agent/nodes/electronics_planner.py`
  - `ElectronicsPlannerSignature`
  - `ElectronicsPlannerNode`
  - `electronics_planner_node()`
- `controller/agent/nodes/electronics_reviewer.py`
  - `electronics_reviewer_node()`
- `controller/agent/graph.py`
  - `route_after_electronics_planner()`
  - `route_after_electronics_reviewer()`
  - `electronics_planner_graph`
  - `electronics_reviewer_graph`
- `controller/agent/prompt_manager.py`
  - electronics role prompt entries and prompt-selection branches
- `controller/agent/handover_constants.py`
  - `ELECTRONICS_REVIEWER_HANDOVER_CHECK`
- `controller/api/routes/episodes.py`
  - `get_episode_schematic()`
- `controller/api/main.py`
  - the electronics/steerability router wiring if it exists only for late-epic behavior
- `worker_heavy/utils/electronics.py`
  - `calculate_power_budget()`
  - `create_circuit()`
  - `route_wire()`
  - `simulate_circuit_transient()`
  - `validate_circuit()`
- `worker_heavy/simulation/electronics.py`
- `worker_heavy/simulation/loop.py`
  - the electronics manager, power-gating, switch-state, and `is_powered_map` branches
- `worker_heavy/simulation/genesis_backend.py`
  - the electronics setup and electronics-fluid-damage branches
- `shared/circuit_builder.py`
- `shared/schematic_utils.py`
- `shared/wire_utils.py`
- `shared/models/schemas.py`
  - electronics and routing fields, including circuit-validation and wiring models
- `shared/enums.py`
  - `AgentName.ELECTRONICS_PLANNER`
  - `AgentName.ELECTRONICS_ENGINEER`
  - `AgentName.ELECTRONICS_REVIEWER`
- `shared/agent_templates/__init__.py`
  - the electronics planner template mapping
- `shared/agent_templates/codex/scripts/submit_engineering_plan.sh`
  - the electronics role gate
- `dataset/data/seed/role_based/electronics_planner.json`
- `dataset/data/seed/role_based/electronics_reviewer.json`
- `dataset/data/seed/artifacts/electronics_planner/**`
- `dataset/data/seed/artifacts/electronics_reviewer/**`
- `tests/electronics/test_integration_electronics.py`
- `tests/integration/architecture_p1/test_electronics_full.py`

Do not preserve `shared/circuit_builder.py` or `shared/wire_utils.py` as
standalone EDA helpers if the electromechanical branch is gone. Those files are
not paper-worthy on their own.

#### Fluids, FEM, and stress

Remove the fluid and deformable-material support surface:

- `worker_heavy/utils/validation.py`
  - `define_fluid()`
  - `get_stress_report()`
  - `preview_stress()`
  - `set_soft_mesh()`
  - `validate_fem_manufacturability()`
- `shared/rendering/stress_heatmap.py`
- `worker_heavy/simulation/objectives.py`
  - the fluid-objective and stress-objective evaluation branches
- `worker_heavy/simulation/genesis_backend.py`
  - the fluid particle, stress-field, and fluid-contact branches
- `worker_heavy/simulation/loop.py`
  - `stress_summaries`
  - `fluid_metrics`
  - the fluid and stress failure upgrade paths
- `shared/models/schemas.py`
  - `fluid_objectives`
  - `stress_objectives`
  - any fluid/stress helper models
- `shared/observability/schemas.py`
  - `FLUID_CONTAINMENT_CHECK`
  - `FLOW_RATE_CHECK`
  - `STRESS_SUMMARY`
  - `MESHING_FAILURE`
  - `PHYSICS_INSTABILITY`
  - `GPU_OOM_RETRY`
- `tests/integration/architecture_p1/test_physics_fluids_full.py`
- `tests/integration/architecture_p1/test_physics_fluids_extended.py`
- `tests/integration/evals_p2/**` if the only reason they exist is to cover the late-epic fluid/FEM path

#### Steerability and live prompt injection

Remove the steering stack as a whole. It is late-stage interaction plumbing,
not a publication requirement for an Epic 7 bundle:

- `controller/graph/steerability_node.py`
  - `steerability_node()`
  - `check_steering()`
- `controller/services/steerability/service.py`
  - `SteerabilityService`
  - `steerability_service`
- `controller/persistence/steering_memory.py`
- `controller/api/routes/steerability.py`
  - `steer_agent()`
  - `get_steering_queue()`
- `controller/agent/graph.py`
  - the `AgentName.STEER` node and all steering conditional edges
- `controller/agent/benchmark/graph.py`
  - the benchmark-side steering edges
- `controller/agent/nodes/base.py`
  - `_get_steer_context()`
- `controller/agent/nodes/planner.py`
  - the `steer_context` input field and extraction path
- `controller/agent/nodes/coder.py`
  - the `steer_context` input field and extraction path
- `controller/api/tasks.py`
  - steerability metadata injection into message payloads
- `controller/api/schemas.py`
  - steerability queue request/response models
- `shared/models/steerability.py`
- `shared/enums.py`
  - `AgentName.STEER`
- `specs/integration-test-list.md`
  - the steering-only `INT-067`, `INT-068`, `INT-179`, `INT-182`, `INT-183`, and related coverage rows

#### Advanced visualization

Keep the basic evidence surface if the paper cites it, but remove advanced UI
visualization for later epics:

- `tests/integration/frontend/**`
- `controller/api/routes/episodes.py`
  - the electronics schematic route if the publication bundle does not retain
    electromechanics
- any frontend or renderer path that exists only to display FEM, fluids, or
  electronics artifacts in-browser

### Internal docs and scans

The following documentation is development support, not conference artifact
material:

- `docs/project-overview.md`
- `docs/source-tree-analysis.md`
- `docs/backend-reference.md`
- `docs/index.md`
- `docs/component-inventory.md`
- `docs/data-models.md`
- `docs/architecture.md`

- `docs/nightly-work-plans/**`
- `docs/agent-workflow/**`

## Module-Level Trim Notes

## Proposed Target State

1. The publication bundle is backend-first and claim-driven.
2. The bundle contains one canonical paper source, one canonical reproducible
   figure path, one canonical prompt source, one canonical skill source, and a
   minimal paper-critical verification surface.
3. The operator UI, website mirror, and experimental probe tree are absent.
4. Generated outputs, logs, compiled exports, caches, and result archives are
   not tracked as source for the submission.
5. Skill training, journalling compression, steerability experiments, mock
   providers, and legacy compatibility wrappers are not part of the conference
   artifact.
6. Technical drawing, electromechanical, fluids/FEM, and steerability branches
   are removed completely because they only become justified after Epic 7.
7. The release manifest is fail-closed: anything not explicitly included is
   excluded, and no dormant late-epic compatibility paths remain.

## Required Work

### 1. Freeze the claim matrix

- Derive the publication claim matrix from
  `docs/academic-submission/final-project-report.tex`.
- Mark each major repository surface as core, retained, or out-of-bundle.
- Use the final camera-ready text, not draft notes, to decide whether a branch
  stays.

### 2. Collapse the academic-submission tree

- Keep one canonical LaTeX source for the paper.
- Keep only the reproducibility inputs that the paper actually cites.
- Remove duplicate drafts, exported PDFs, log files, and alternate formats.
- Convert anything not cited by the paper into archive-only material.

### 3. Remove presentation, website, and probe surfaces

- Remove `frontend/` from the publication bundle.
- Remove `website/` from the publication bundle.
- Remove `scripts/experiments/` from the publication bundle.
- Remove any generated render, log, or benchmark result file that is not cited
  as a reproducibility input.

### 4. Remove compatibility and training-only machinery

- Remove legacy mirror trees such as `worker_light/agent_files/`.
- Remove generic wrapper scripts that only exist for older launch paths.
- Remove mock LLMs, mock scenarios, drafting helpers, steerability services,
  and other maintenance-only control paths.
- Remove the standalone training/autopilot CLIs that are not required to
  reproduce the final paper's claims.

### 5. Prune observability to the paper-critical subset

- Keep the events needed to explain the published workflows.
- Remove generic file/tool telemetry, technical-drawing preview telemetry,
  late-epic electromechanical telemetry, and skill-loop telemetry that only
  exists for internal debugging or training.
- Remove any event family whose only real claim is outside Epic 7, including
  the drafting-preview events, electronics events, fluid/stress events, and
  steerability events.

### 6. Curate the data and tests

- Keep only the seed rows and generated artifacts that reproduce the published
  benchmark families.
- Remove generated corpora and helper-role seed families that are not part of
  the paper.
- Remove seed rows that only exist to toggle `technical_drawing_mode`,
  electronics, steerability, or late-epic multiphysics fixtures.
- Reduce integration coverage to the paper-critical slice and drop the rest.

### 7. Collapse late-epic branches

- Remove the technical-drawing contract, drafting mode, and preview plumbing.
- Remove the electronics/electromechanical branch end-to-end.
- Remove the fluids, FEM, and stress branch end-to-end.
- Remove steerability end-to-end.
- Do not leave behind a partial branch, compatibility alias, or dormant config
  switch for any Epic 8+ surface.

### 8. Publish a fail-closed manifest

- Add a publication manifest or equivalent release profile.
- Make packaging consume the manifest rather than the whole repository tree.
- Require an explicit include list. Anything omitted stays out.

## Non-Goals

- No redesign of the controller, worker, or shared-contract architecture.
- No new benchmark family or new scientific claim beyond the paper.
- No rewrite of the paper narrative to justify keeping extra code.
- No attempt to erase development history from git; only the publication bundle
  is being pruned.
- No frontend redesign and no website redesign.

## Sequencing

The safe order is:

1. Freeze the claim matrix from the final paper.
2. Add the publication manifest and define the fail-closed package boundary.
3. Collapse the academic-submission tree to one canonical paper source and one
   reproducibility path.
4. Remove the presentation, website, experimental, legacy-compatibility, and
   late-epic feature surfaces.
5. Prune the training-only, observability-long-tail, dataset, and test bulk.
6. Collapse late-epic branches to nothing rather than leaving dormant
   compatibility paths.
7. Record the final bundle contents and the rationale for every exclusion.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The publication bundle has a documented manifest that names the minimal
   files and directories required to rebuild the conference artifact.
2. A clean publication checkout does not require `frontend/`, `website/`, or
   `scripts/experiments/` to reproduce the paper.
3. The bundle contains one canonical paper source and no tracked generated
   PDF, log, or duplicate draft artifacts.
4. Generated outputs, caches, logs, and render bundles are excluded from the
   source release.
5. The curated test set covers the benchmark generator, engineer solver,
   render evidence, simulation, and handover contract paths that the paper
   claims.
6. The publication bundle still satisfies the core architecture contracts for
   the published workflows, and nothing else.
7. The bundle contains no technical-drawing, electronics, fluids/FEM, or
   steerability runtime branch in code, config, prompts, seed data, or tests.

## Migration Checklist

### Claim matrix

- [ ] Freeze the final-paper claim matrix from
  `docs/academic-submission/final-project-report.tex`.
- [ ] Mark every major repo surface as core, retained, or out-of-bundle.
- [ ] Remove every feature family whose first meaningful claim appears in
  Epic 8 or later, including drafting, electronics, fluids/FEM, and
  steering.

### Paper artifacts

- [ ] Collapse `docs/academic-submission/` to one canonical paper source and
  the minimal reproducibility inputs it needs.
- [ ] Remove duplicate drafts, exported PDFs, logs, and alternate formats.
- [ ] Archive any unused alternate paper notes or matrix files.

### Runtime bundle trim

- [ ] Remove `frontend/` from the default publication bundle.
- [ ] Remove `website/` from the default publication bundle.
- [ ] Remove `scripts/experiments/` from the default publication bundle.
- [ ] Remove `worker_light/agent_files/` from the default publication bundle.
- [ ] Remove mock-provider, steerability, and legacy-wrapper surfaces.
- [ ] Remove technical-drawing plumbing, electronics planner/reviewer
  surfaces, and late-epic simulation helpers from the default bundle.

### Training, observability, and data

- [ ] Remove the standalone skill-training/autopilot CLIs.
- [ ] Trim `shared/observability/schemas.py` to the paper-critical event set,
  excluding drafting, electronics, fluids, and steering events.
- [ ] Remove `dataset/data/generated/` from the source release path.
- [ ] Curate the seed rows to the paper-critical role families only and remove
  any `technical_drawing_mode` or late-epic seed variants.

### Verification and docs

- [ ] Curate the dataset and integration-test surface down to the paper-
  critical subset.
- [ ] Remove the technical-drawing fixture families and late-epic branch
  tests from the release candidate.
- [ ] Update the repository overview docs to distinguish the publication
  bundle from the development tree, or exclude them entirely if the release
  manifest no longer ships docs.
- [ ] Record the final publication bundle contents and the rationale for each
  excluded surface.

publication manifest.
