# Simulation and Rendering

## Scope summary

- Primary focus: physics simulation contract, backend split, and rendering behavior.
- Defines constraints realism rules, allowed mechanisms/components, and CAD-joint-to-simulator mapping.
- Specifies simulation constants, backend assumptions, and validation expectations.
- Detailed fluids/deformables and electromechanical modality contracts live in [fluids-and-deformables.md](./fluids-and-deformables.md) and [electronics-and-electromechanics.md](./electronics-and-electromechanics.md).

### Dedicated renderer worker

All render execution runs in a dedicated headless `worker-renderer` container, including:

1. static validation preview renders,
2. dynamic simulation videos and other runtime evidence artifacts,
3. selection snapshots, depth renders, segmentation renders, and render-manifest generation.

The physics backends do not own render process state. They supply scene state, camera policy, and render-capability metadata; the renderer worker owns the graphics stack and executes the render job inside its own container boundary.

The render worker is containerized in every environment, including development, so the graphics stack stays isolated from simulation and from the controller process.

## Genesis for simulation

While this platform has notable downsides for future use, we pick Genesis because it supports fluid interaction and Finite Element analysis; being fast enough to work.

Operational benchmarking notes, runtime optimization attempts, and dated performance measurements for the simulation stack are tracked in [auxillary/simulation-optimization-attempts.md](./auxillary/simulation-optimization-attempts.md).

### Runtime cost model

For architecture and optimization decisions, we treat simulation runtime cost as three separate layers:

1. Process-global cold cost.
   - Python child startup.
   - module import and runtime setup.
   - Genesis runtime initialization.
   - process-local compiler and backend warmup.
2. Scene-specific build cost.
   - scene creation,
   - mesh conversion,
   - geometry-specific build work,
   - collision and backend scene preparation,
   - object-family-specific compilation work when it occurs.
3. Actual simulation execution cost.
   - stepping the physics scene,
   - rendering or artifact creation if requested,
   - result extraction and validation logic.

This distinction is mandatory for future optimization work because different changes affect different layers.

- A persistent dedicated simulation child removes repeated process-global cold cost across requests on the same worker instance.
- A persistent child does not, by itself, remove scene-specific build cost for materially different scenes.
- Scene-specific cost reduction requires separate caching or reuse strategies such as compiled-scene caching, mesh caching, or geometry-hash caches.

The optimization log dated 2026-03-09 records the evidence for this split. In particular:

- the earlier init benchmark showed that literal `gs.init()` is not the dominant repeated cost by itself,
- the follow-up warm-process benchmark showed that different-scene-next cost is real, but still does not fully reset to the original cold-process cost for the primitive case,
- the minimal mesh case showed nearly identical warm-process cost for same-versus-different OBJ scenes in that experiment.
- the direct `simulate_subprocess(...)` benchmark on two distinct successful bundles, using distinct `session_id` values and both bundle orders, measured fresh-child totals of `125.8s` to `127.9s` and reused-child totals of `80.2s` to `80.9s`,
- the same direct benchmark measured second-request wall-clock time dropping from `31.4s` to `32.1s` in fresh-child mode down to `2.4s` to `2.5s` in reused-child mode, which is the strongest current evidence that the repeated cost is in process lifecycle and warm-runtime loss rather than same-session backend caching.

The architecture implication is explicit:

- we should not discuss "simulation startup cost" as if it were one number,
- we should separately measure and optimize process-global cold cost and scene-specific build cost,
- we should not reject the persistent-child design merely because different scenes still pay real rebuild cost.

### Persistent child runtime direction

The current optimization direction is now concrete enough to treat as an implementation plan rather than only a hypothesis.

The runtime direction is:

1. Keep `worker-heavy` single-flight.
2. Keep the process boundary between the FastAPI parent and the simulation runtime.
3. Replace one-fresh-child-per-request execution in `simulation_runner.py` with one persistent dedicated child executor per worker instance for `simulate` and `validate`.
4. Recreate that executor fail-closed after `BrokenProcessPool` or explicit shutdown.
5. Add explicit child-side cleanup functions that clear backend or session state without killing the warm process.

The benchmark evidence makes one point explicit:

- the implementation target is process reuse,
- not thread reuse,
- not repeated same-session backend reuse,
- and not a narrow micro-optimization around the literal `gs.init()` call.

The persistent-child refactor therefore has to preserve the existing behavior contracts while changing only the child lifecycle:

1. Public `/benchmark/*` request and response contracts stay unchanged.
2. `/ready` and heavy-admission semantics stay unchanged.
3. The current request fails closed if the child crashes.
4. The next request recreates a fresh child.
5. Child cleanup is explicit and observable rather than being an accidental side effect of process exit.

The detailed dated plan for this refactor is recorded in `auxillary/simulation-optimization-attempts.md`.

### Warm-child backend cache split

The persistent child keeps backend caches split by both session and backend type.

The cache rule is:

1. A session may hold a warm MuJoCo backend and a warm Genesis backend at the same time.
2. `/benchmark/validate` static preview reuse must not overwrite or alias the backend instance later used by `/benchmark/simulate`.
3. Backend cache lookup is therefore keyed by `(session_id, backend_type)`, not by `session_id` alone.
4. Session cleanup closes all cached backend instances for that session, not only the most recent one.

The reason is architectural rather than incidental:

- `/benchmark/validate` now uses build123d/VTK for static preview by default,
- `/benchmark/simulate` may still use Genesis for the same session,
- a single shared per-session backend cache would let the validation-preview path poison the later simulation path with the wrong backend instance.

This split preserves warm-process reuse while keeping the validate-preview/backend-selection contract correct.

### Backend responsibility split

We do not use one backend for every purpose.

The backend contract is:

1. `physics.backend` selects the physics simulation backend.
2. Genesis remains the backend for Genesis-only simulation behavior such as FEM and fluids.
3. Static 24-view validation preview rendering uses build123d/VTK by default and is executed by the renderer worker.
4. The static validation preview path is a fast geometry/context artifact path, not a Genesis-runtime proof path.

This means `/benchmark/validate` and `/benchmark/simulate` are intentionally asymmetric:

1. `/benchmark/validate`
   - checks geometry/objective consistency,
   - generates static preview artifacts,
   - uses build123d/VTK for that static preview by default through the renderer worker,
   - preserves the same script-source snapshot selected by the parent request when it launches an isolated preview child, so inline `script_content` and non-default `script_path` entrypoints do not get silently replaced by `working_dir/script.py`,
   - does not add an extra Genesis load/render/build gate solely for parity checking,
   - fails closed on duplicate top-level labels or labels that use the reserved `environment` or `zone_` namespaces, because MJCF mesh/body names are derived from authored labels and the simulator owns the scene root and `zone_*` bodies.
2. `/benchmark/simulate`
   - runs the selected physics backend,
   - remains the runtime path for Genesis-specific behavior when Genesis is selected.
   - requests dynamic render/video artifacts through the renderer worker when simulation evidence is needed.

Genesis-specific runtime behavior is therefore established by actual Genesis simulation runs where Genesis behavior is required, not by duplicating a Genesis render/build check inside fast validation.

### Render profile ownership

The render contract for dynamic simulation evidence is runtime-resolved and recorded with the simulation result, not by benchmark-level task config or agent config.

The rule is:

1. The selected physics backend determines the renderer family for simulation video, but the render job itself is executed by the renderer worker.
2. The renderer backend exposes a typed capability record that states what artifact modes and view policies it supports.
3. The runtime-selected simulation render choice is serialized in `simulation_result.json` so reviewers can replay the exact evidence path.
4. Static build123d/VTK preview remains a separate preview contract, executed by the renderer worker, and continues to live in the preview manifest path.
5. If a backend cannot satisfy the selected render path, the failure should surface as a validation/runtime contract error rather than being hidden behind an unrelated global fallback.

This keeps MuJoCo and Genesis distinct while still allowing each backend to use its own canonical default view when the runtime resolver allows that.

Agent-facing inspection of persisted simulation video is config-driven. When `config/agents_config.yaml` sets `render.split_video_renders_to_images=true`, `inspect_media(...)` may decode an `.mp4` artifact into representative image frames and attach those frames to the model instead of exposing the raw video bytes as a dead end. The sampling stride is controlled by `render.video_frame_attachment_stride`, so a 60-frame video with stride 6 yields 10 attached frames, while a 6-frame video yields 1 attached frame. `render.video_frame_jpeg_quality_percent` controls the JPEG encoding quality as a percent value. The stored MP4 remains the canonical simulation artifact; the split only affects multimodal review.

<!-- Downsides of MuJoCo?

- we won't support deformation (finite element analysis)
- we won't support fluids-->

## Simulation constants and assumptions

We operate in a real-world-like scenario, with rigid bodies, gravity, real-world materials, and standard properties like friction and restitution (bounciness).

Benchmark-owned fixtures may be fixed, partially constrained, motorized, or fully free when they are part of the benchmark contract. That benchmark-side contract can be weaker than the engineer-solution contract, but it still must stay deterministic, reviewable, and compatible with the simulation evidence path. Engineer-authored objects remain physically realistic and must satisfy the normal constraint rules.

Benchmarked time of execution for Genesis, simulating one-two FEM parts - 20s on dev mode.

### Physically-realistic constraints

In the end, our systems should be transferrable to the real world.

For engineers, constraints must be physically realistic. Meaning: if an engineer agent tries to constrain two parts together, they need to use fasteners or make a mechanism which would fit two parts together. However, the engineer can't constrain two parts by just assigning them a CAD constraint.
This is because it fits how physics works in the real world, transferring to which is ultimately the goal of this project.

We can perhaps verify it by simply adding realistic fastener logic.

Similarly, while you can constrain a ball to a plane in CAD, you can't do so in real life. In real life, a ball needs to have a special holder. Two flat planes can't be constrained to each other, you need to either add them, make a real constraint that would hold them together.

#### Creating realistic constraints

Constraints done by the engineer should be enforced for validity. E.g.: two parts should be actually close together.

##### Fixed parts for the simulation definition

Some parts will need to be "fixed" despite physics *during benchmark generation, not agents*, specifically for the implementation. We can pass `fixed=True` to the models as a custom parameter (or metadata).

##### Fasteners

We use **build123d's native `RigidJoint` system** for mating parts. This avoids custom positioning math — build123d handles transforms automatically via `connect_to()`. Fastener geometry (bolts, screws, nuts) comes from the [`bd-warehouse`](https://bd-warehouse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fastener.html) package.

**Helper function**: `fastener_hole(part, location, hole_id: str, size="M3", length=10.0, hole_type=HoleType.CounterBoreHole, add_fastener=False, fit="Normal")`

1. Cuts a fastener hole at the specified `location`
2. Creates a `RigidJoint` at the hole location with a parameter `rigid_joint.hole_id=hole_id`
3. If `add_fastener=True`, inserts appropriate fastener from bd-warehouse catalog
4. Returns the modified part

The type of Hole is determined by an enum - HoleType: `FlatHeadHole`, `CounterBoreHole`, `CounterSinkHole` for according types of holes.

##### Agent workflow for fasteners

```python
from utils.fasteners import fastener_hole
from build123d import Location

# Create bracket (anchor part) - explicitly positioned
bracket = Box(100, 50, 10)
bracket = fastener_hole(bracket, location=Location((20, 25)), size="M5", length=10.0, hole_id="mount_1")
bracket = fastener_hole(bracket, location=Location((80, 25)), size="M5", length=10.0, hole_id="mount_2")
bracket.position = (0, 0, 100)  # world position

# Create arm - will be positioned via joint mating
arm = Box(200, 30, 8)
arm = fastener_hole(arm, location=Location((10, 15)), size="M5", length=8.0, hole_id="arm_1", add_fastener=True)
arm = fastener_hole(arm, location=Location((50, 15)), size="M5", length=8.0, hole_id="arm_2", add_fastener=True)

# Mate parts - build123d computes transform automatically
arm.joints["arm_1"].connect_to(bracket.joints["mount_1"])
arm.joints["arm_2"].connect_to(bracket.joints["mount_2"])
```

After `connect_to()`, the arm is automatically positioned so holes align. **No manual rotation/translation math needed.**

Note: hole names are given readable names, e.g. explicit names like "front_mount" or "pivot_hole" for easier identification. In fact, the hole name serves as a local label for the joint. So that we can reference the build123d joint with its hole name.

"""
Without hole_id:

```python
# How would you reference the joint?
arm.joints[???].connect_to(bracket.joints[???])
```

With hole_id:

```python
arm.joints["arm_1"].connect_to(bracket.joints["mount_1"])
```

"""
**Validation rules**:

- Single-fastener connections are **rejected** (underconstrained — allows rotation around bolt axis)
- Minimum 2 fasteners required for rigid connection between parts \<!-- Note: this is not true, actually. You can design such inserts that only 1 will be sufficient. But, let it be.>
- Hole diameters must match between mated pairs
- Can't connect holes with both `add_fastener=True`. <!--Note: not a hard constraint - if it's difficult to do, skip.-->

**MJCF translation**:

1. Walk assembly, find all `RigidJoint` pairs that are connected
2. For each connected pair: emit `<weld body1="..." body2="..."/>` constraint
3. Fastener geometry is included in physics only as a visual (cosmetic in CAD renders only) <!-- (I don't care about making that collision with head. Actually, it's rather simple - just put the fastener at its last position in CAD. But still.) -->

##### Edge case: multiple holes

The `hole_id` is **local to each Part**, not a global identifier. When one central part connects to multiple identical parts, each child part can have the same `hole_id` (e.g., `"attach"`) — the matching happens via explicit `connect_to()` calls:

```python
# 4 identical legs with same local hole_id
for i, leg in enumerate(legs):
    leg.joints["attach"].connect_to(bracket.joints[f"mount_{i+1}"])
```

This avoids the need for global ID management or dict-based hole matching.

##### Mechanisms and Moving Parts

Genesis (which has parity with MuJoCo) constraints will only ever be spawned from predefined components. Meaning, a "revolute constraint" will only ever be spawned if there is either a:

1. Bearing (ideally),
2. Motor,
3. Through hole intentionally created for two parts.

For each, the internal/external diameters must match, and there will be special commands on how to define these. In addition, the critic will be prompted to specifically scrutinize if the constraint is valid. In addition, parts will have to be close to each other physically - distance between both must be nearing \<1 mm or so.

This is to prevent Engineering Coder and Benchmark Coder from creating impossible constraints.

To support moving parts (hinges, sliders, motors), we force build123d Joints from *to be created from predefined CAD components* almost always - e.g., again, revolute joints from bearings, rigid joints/weld constraints via fasteners.

##### Benchmark fixture motion exception

Benchmark-owned moving fixtures are reviewed under an explicit-motion contract, not the engineering minimum-DOF rule.

The rule is:

1. benchmark fixtures may be fixed, partially constrained, motorized, or fully free when the benchmark contract explicitly requires that behavior,
2. benchmark fixtures may be implicitly powered in MVP and do not require full wiring realism,
3. benchmark fixtures may use motors, bearings, and other COTS parts as read-only environment components when their identity is explicit, and they are not treated as manufacturable engineer outputs,
4. benchmark handoff artifacts must explicitly document the fixture motion contract, including stable identity, motion kind/topology, axis/path or equivalent reference, bounds or operating envelope, trigger mode, and whether the engineer may rely on that motion,
5. reviewers validate the declared motion against simulation evidence and reject missing, contradictory, unsupported, or non-deterministic motion; they do not apply the engineering minimum-DOF rule to benchmark fixtures,
6. benchmark-side motion must stay deterministic enough that engineering can reason about the environment from the declared handoff artifacts and simulation evidence,
7. benchmark fixtures are validation setup, not engineer-owned solution parts, so manufacturability checks do not apply to them.

<!-- Future work: if benchmark input arrives as STEP, infer candidate constraint/motion metadata from the source geometry before materializing the explicit benchmark motion contract. -->

This exception is benchmark-only. It does not relax engineering realism requirements.

##### Engineering DOF minimality rule

For engineering solutions, DOFs are constrained by intent, not by convenience.

1. Default state is static (`dofs: []`) for all parts.
2. A part may receive non-empty `dofs` only when the mechanism requires real motion to satisfy the objective.
3. Each non-empty DOF assignment must map to a physical mechanism (bearing/motor/slider or equivalent allowed component) and a reviewer-visible rationale in planning artifacts.
4. Excessive or unjustified DOFs are treated as a review failure (plan stage and/or execution stage), even if a single simulation run passes.

For benchmark-owned fixtures, the rule is explicit-motion validation:

1. benchmark-side DOFs are not minimized for their own sake,
2. a fully constrained rigid part has 0 DOF,
3. a fully free rigid part has 6 DOF,
4. reviewers validate the declared motion against the handoff artifacts and dynamic evidence,
5. reviewers reject benchmark fixtures whose motion cannot be reconstructed from the declared contract or whose evidence contradicts the declaration.

Notably this will also be affected when we will (later) transfer to deformable body simulation and we'll need to find ways how to make simulation stronger:

Map of joints to Genesis (which has parity with MuJoCo) constraints and their uses:

1. RigidJoint to `<weld>` constraint:
   - Used for fasteners and fixed connections.
   - Connects two bodies rigidly at the joint location.
2. **RevoluteJoint** to `<joint type="hinge">`:
   - Used for axles, pivots, and motors.
   - The joint axis in build123d becomes the hinge axis in Genesis.
   - If the joint is motorized, we add an `<actuator>` targeting this joint.
3. **PrismaticJoint** -> `<joint type="slide">`:
   - Used for linear sliders and rails.
   - The joint axis defines the slide direction.
   - Can be motorized with a `<position>` or `<motor>` actuator.

##### Implementation Logic for constraints

- Walk the `build123d` assembly and inspect `part.joints`.
- If a joint is connected (via `connect_to`), identify the two parts involved.
- Assert the joint is valid programmatically (distance, not conflicting with other constraints, etc.)
- Generate the appropriate Genesis/MuJoCo XML element connecting the two bodies.
- Assign stable names to identifying joints so controllers can reference them (e.g. "motor_joint").

#### Constraining to the environment

Oftentimes engineers will need to constrain machinery to the environment, e.g. to the floor. However, not all things can be constrained to, e.g. you don't want to drill a motor some other machine.

The Benchmark Planner creates explicit drillable or non-drillable constraints on benchmark-owned environment parts in `benchmark_definition.yaml benchmark_parts[].metadata.attachment_policy`.

The Engineering Planner will get a visual confirmation of drillable/non-drillable objects via a texture or a separate set of renders, and the machine-readable handoff path is:

1. benchmark-side attachment and drill permissions live in `benchmark_definition.yaml`,
2. the engineer may use that attachment policy, but does not need to use it if the benchmark can be solved another way,
3. if a benchmark-owned part is declared in `benchmark_definition.yaml`, engineer-owned parts in `assembly_definition.yaml` may attach to it only through the permitted attachment policy,
4. planner-declared intended drilled fastener holes live in `assembly_definition.yaml.environment_drill_operations`,
5. planner handoff submission and reviewer entry both fail closed if those planned drill operations violate the benchmark-side drill policy.

##### Specifics

If the benchmark fixture exposes no `drill_policy`, drilling is forbidden by default.

The Benchmark Planner and Benchmark Coder declare whole-part drillability, not drilling zones. The engineer decides where on the allowed benchmark part to place holes.

The benchmark-owned drill policy specifies realistic numeric limits such as minimum and maximum hole diameter, maximum drill depth, and maximum hole count for that part.

Drilling benchmark-owned fixtures has non-zero cost. For MVP that cost is static and comes from `manufacturing_config.yaml`.

#### Allowed components in simulation

The simulation would have only a set number of components that both the benchmark planner and engineer can use. The following list is acceptable:

1. 3d CAD parts:
   - Environment (unmodifiable, or modifiable with minor changes, e.g. drilling);
     - Objectives (goal, forbid zones)
     - Parts (any obstacle/standard CAD object) <!-- probably needs for a better name-->
     - Input objects (e.g. - a ball that needs to be delivered somewhere.)
   - Engineer parts:
     - 3d CAD parts representing real-life objects that engineers would normally create; bound by all physics.
2. Motors (and simple scripts/functions that run the motors, e.g. in sinusoidal wave, or start/stop every few seconds). Accessible by both engineer and benchmark generator.
3. Fasteners - Accessible by both engineer and benchmark generator, however likely environment doesn't really need them.

<!-- Future:
Bearings.
Gears,
PCBs
Wires
Fluid vessels, e.g. pipes, hoses, or tanks that supply each. 
Fluid pumps.-->

- Default stretch - 0.5\*0.5\*0.5 to 2*2*2, disproportionally
- Collision:
  - How often is the simulation checked for collision with goals - every 0.05s.
  - Number of vertices needed for collision - 1 (maybe more in the future)
- Units: Metric.
- Safety factor (for motors and parts breaking) 20%.

## Convex decomposition

<!-- We don't have convex decomposition logic in MuJoCo (we do in Genesis, but we'll approach it later). We'll need a V-HACD logic on worker. -->

Genesis supports convex decomposition natively.

<!-- Note: I have no clue about how V-HACD works. Assume good defaults. -->

## Motors

We use standard Genesis/MuJoCo actuators. They need to be controller by the controller functions.

### Controller functions

We need to define how motors will behave, and we'll use a controller. For this, create a util package like `controllers`, which would have time and position-based controllers.

#### Time-based functions (take in `t` as time)

1. Constant - `constant(power:float) -> float` <!-- as far as I understand, a standard MuJoCo <motor> -->
2. Sinusoidal - `sinusoidal(t: float, power:float) -> float`
3. "full-on, full-off" - a.k.a. a "square" function in signals - `square(time_on_time_off: list[tuple[float,float]], power:float) -> float` - takes in lists of time when to start and stop; and how much power it would output.
4. "smooth on, smooth off"- a.k.a. a "trapezoidal function" in signals `trapezoidal(time_on_time_off: list[tuple[float,float]], power, ramp_up_time: float)`

Note: I'm not a pro in these functions - maybe they need renaming. but that's the idea.

Note: they will need to be importable utils, just as tools like `simulate` are.

#### Implementation for time-based controller functions

One easy way to implement it is to define a dict of control functions, then pass it to simulation logic, and it would control the motors by their control functions. The `assembly_definition.yaml` `final_assembly.parts` entries will contain which controller functions the motors are referencing.

#### Position-based functions

Oftentimes we'll want to control motors through positions, e.g. servos or stepper motors. Define a set of functions that would do inverse kinematics (rotate the motor to a given position, at least).

We want to allow to do something like "at 5 seconds, rotate to 45deg, then at 10 seconds, rotate to 0, and at 15 seconds rotate back to 45 deg." This will also involve Python functions (probably pre-determined). At least a basic set of these (time-based, constant).

<!-- In the future work, I presume, full inverse kinematics pipelines are desired. I know they are trivial in Genesis, it seems not so much in MuJoCo. -->

<!-- Notably, MuJoCo already has some... motor types: " MuJoCo has `position`, `velocity`, `motor` actuators". I don't know how they work -->

<!-- moving-part metadata stays out of benchmark_definition.yaml and lives in assembly_definition.yaml final_assembly.parts; benchmark fixture metadata may live in benchmark_definition.yaml under benchmark_parts. -->

##### Position-based controllers implementation

""" AI-generated, I'm not a pro in the MuJoCo motors.
For position-based control (servos, steppers), we use **MuJoCo's native `<position>` actuator**:

```xml
<actuator>
  <position name="servo1" joint="arm_hinge" 
            kp="{kp_from_COTS}" kv="{kv_from_COTS}"
            forcerange="-{max_torque_nm} {max_torque_nm}"/>
</actuator>
```

**Key differences from `<motor>`**:

- **`ctrl[i]` meaning**: Target position (radians for hinge, meters for slide) – *not* torque
- **Internal PD control**: MuJoCo applies `torque = kp * (target - pos) - kv * vel`
- **Physics-based tracking**: The joint "seeks" the target position naturally (no teleportation)
- **`forcerange`**: Clamps output torque to realistic motor limits (prevents infinite force)

**PD gain tuning** (critical for stability):

- Gains must be tuned relative to body inertia
- Low inertia + high kp = numerical explosion
- Safe starting point: `kp=5`, `kv=0.5` with `mass=1`, `diaginertia=0.01`
- Add joint `damping` to improve stability further

**Available position controllers** (`worker_heavy.utils.controllers`):

- `waypoint(schedule: list[tuple[float, float]])`: Move to target positions at scheduled times
- `hold_position(target: float)`: Hold a fixed target position
- `oscillate(center, amplitude, frequency, phase)`: Sinusoidal position oscillation

"""

Notably, we have a set of COTS motors in COTS section below. We need to assume/research COTS actuator strength and parameters.

### Actuator force limits (forcerange)

MuJoCo's `forcerange` attribute clamps the actuator output to realistic torque limits:

```xml
<!-- Example: MG996R hobby servo with ~1.1 N·m max torque -->
<position name="servo" joint="arm" kp="15" kv="0.8" forcerange="-1.1 1.1"/>
```

**Behavior**:

- If PD control computes torque > `forcerange`, it's clamped to the limit
- Motor "struggles" realistically when overloaded (can't reach target)
- Simulation does NOT fail from clamping alone (see below for failure logic)

**Source of values**: `forcerange` comes from COTS servo catalog (`max_torque_nm` field).

### Motor overload failure

We don't want motors to break; set the maximum *sustained* load threshold above the servo's rated torque.
If a motor is clamped at `forcerange` for more than **2 seconds continuous**, the simulation fails with `motor_overload`.

This forces agents to:

1. Pick appropriately-sized motors for the load
2. Design mechanisms that don't exceed torque limits
