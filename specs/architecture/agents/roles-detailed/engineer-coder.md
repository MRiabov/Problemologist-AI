# Engineering Coder

## Role Summary

The Engineering Coder turns the approved engineering handoff into `solution_script.py`.

## What It Owns

- `solution_script.py`
- supporting `*.py` implementation files
- `todo.md`
- `journal.md`
- `plan_refusal.md` when the approved plan is genuinely infeasible
- `renders/current-episode/` scratch evidence during the active run
- the validation and simulation artifacts produced by the latest revision

## What It Reads

- `plan.md`
- `todo.md`
- `assembly_definition.yaml`
- `benchmark_definition.yaml`
- `benchmark_assembly_definition.yaml`
- `benchmark_script.py` when it exists
- `benchmark_plan_evidence_script.py` when it exists
- `benchmark_plan_technical_drawing_script.py` when it exists
- `plan_refusal.md` when present
- `solution_plan_evidence_script.py`
- `solution_plan_technical_drawing_script.py`
- `validation_results.json`
- `simulation_result.json`
- `scene.json`
- `renders/benchmark_renders/**`
- `renders/engineer_plan_renders/**`
- `renders/final_solution_submission_renders/**`
- `renders/current-episode/**` when it exists

## Native Tool Surface

- `list_files`
- `read_file`
- `inspect_media`
- `write_file`
- `edit_file`
- `grep`
- `execute_command`
- `inspect_topology`
- `invoke_cots_search_subagent`

## Runtime Helpers To Use From Scripts

- `from utils.submission import validate, simulate, submit_for_review`
- `from utils.preview import preview, preview_drawing, objectives_geometry, list_render_bundles, query_render_bundle, pick_preview_pixel, pick_preview_pixels`

## What Humans Must Tell It

- The approved plan package is the binding contract.
- `assembly_definition.yaml`, `benchmark_definition.yaml`, `benchmark_assembly_definition.yaml`, and the planner drafting scripts are read-only context after plan approval.
- The coder preserves the exact labels, repeated quantities, COTS identities, budgets, and geometry relationships in the handoff.
- `solution_plan_technical_drawing_script.py` is the presentation companion, not a second geometry contract.
- Validate and simulate the latest revision before requesting review.
- Inspect render or video evidence when it exists; do not rely on text-only summaries.
- Use `plan_refusal.md` only when the approved plan is genuinely infeasible.
- If payload trajectory data exists, keep the coarse and fine motion contracts aligned.

## Acceptance Checklist

- `solution_script.py` imports safely.
- The implementation solves the approved benchmark objective.
- Validation passes.
- Simulation passes for the latest revision.
- The final handoff is review-ready and evidence-backed.
