# Agents

## Scope summary

- Primary focus: top-level architecture map of the agent layer.
- Defines the two main workflows: benchmark generator and engineer.
- Use this file first when deciding which agent-specific spec to open next.

We have two agents (or agent graphs): the benchmark generator and the engineer.

Runtime conversations use four message roles: `system`, `user`, `assistant`, and `tool`.
`assistant` is the agent-authored/model role; `tool` is runtime-owned tool responses; `system` carries deterministic runtime control messages such as gates, reminders, and recovery instructions.

## Benchmark generator workflow

The benchmark generator flow is:

1. `Benchmark Planner`
2. `Benchmark Plan Reviewer`
3. `Benchmark Coder`
4. `Benchmark Reviewer`

The split between benchmark plan review and benchmark execution review is mandatory.

- `Benchmark Plan Reviewer` checks planner-hand-off quality before implementation starts and persists reviewer output to the benchmark-plan review YAML pair in `reviews/`.
- `Benchmark Reviewer` remains the post-validation/post-simulation review gate for the implemented benchmark environment and persists reviewer output to the benchmark-execution review YAML pair in `reviews/`.
- After plan approval, a single `Benchmark Coder` creates and owns benchmark geometry changes in `benchmark_script.py` and any helper implementation modules. The `Benchmark Planner` does not receive `benchmark_script.py` before plan approval.

## Engineering workflow

The engineering flow has two separate review stages:

1. `Engineering Planner` (+ `Electronics Planner`)
2. `Engineering Plan Reviewer` (plan-quality gate before coding)
3. `Engineering Coder` (unified mechanical + electrical implementation)
4. `Electronics Reviewer` (conditional electromechanical review stage when electronics are required)
5. `Engineering Execution Reviewer` (post-validation/post-simulation execution gate)

The split between plan and execution reviewers is mandatory.

Implementation ownership is intentionally unified.

- `Engineering Planner` and `Electronics Planner` may both refine planner-owned artifacts before the plan-review gate.

- After plan approval, a single `Engineering Coder` owns implementation changes to `solution_script.py` and any helper implementation modules.

- We do not run separate mechanical and electrical implementation agents in sequence for the same workspace revision. That late serialized split creates avoidable cross-domain handoff damage when wiring, PSU placement, connector access, or route clearance require mechanical adjustments.

- `Electronics Reviewer` stays as a specialist review gate for explicit-electronics tasks, but it reviews the unified coder output rather than owning a separate coding pass.

- Plan review checks planning quality and contract completeness before implementation starts, and persists reviewer output to an engineering-plan review YAML pair in `reviews/`.

- Execution review runs only after validation/simulation success artifacts are present for the latest revision, then checks robustness/non-flakiness and plan adherence, and persists reviewer output to an engineering-execution review YAML pair in `reviews/`.

- Visual-inspection policy for vision-using roles is config-driven via `config/agents_config.yaml`; required roles must inspect render images through `inspect_media(...)` before valid completion/approval when images are available for the current node/revision (`submit_review` for reviewer native loops, `finish` for non-reviewer native loops).
