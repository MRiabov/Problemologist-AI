# Agent Artifact Contracts

## Purpose

This directory is the canonical library for file-level acceptance criteria in seeded eval workspaces.
Each document explains what the artifact is for, which hard checks it must satisfy, what makes it high quality, and what reviewers should look for when validating it.

Use this library when a role must seed or judge a concrete workspace file rather than a generic stage concept.

## How To Use

1. Open this index first to identify the artifact family.
2. Open the matching artifact contract before authoring or reviewing a seed.
3. Use `specs/architecture/agents/handover-contracts.md` and `specs/architecture/agents/artifacts-and-filesystem.md` for the surrounding stage and ownership rules.
4. Treat these documents as canonical; the eval-creation skill references should point here rather than duplicate the contract text.

## Contract Rule

The artifact contracts in this directory are the source of truth for file-level seeded-eval acceptance.
If a workflow guide, seed helper, or role sheet disagrees with one of these documents, the document here wins until the higher-level architecture is deliberately revised.
