# Engineering Plan

## 1. Solution Overview

Use a passive low-angle chute with tall guide walls and a shaped bypass around the central forbid block to move the low-friction cube into the goal zone. The geometry avoids relying on friction and instead constrains the cube with continuous walls and gentle transitions.

## 2. Parts List

| Part                 | Dimensions (mm) | Material      | Purpose                                                              |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| slide_base           | 620 x 140 x 10  | aluminum_6061 | Freestanding base for the low-friction guide path                    |
| entry_box            | 160 x 120 x 38  | hdpe          | Wide entry pocket that catches the jittered cube without rebound     |
| guide_wall_left      | 420 x 18 x 42   | hdpe          | Left continuous wall guiding the cube around the blocker             |
| guide_wall_right     | 390 x 18 x 42   | hdpe          | Right continuous wall shaping the bypass path                        |
| blocker_bypass_panel | 200 x 18 x 65   | hdpe          | Panel that keeps the cube from sliding into the central forbid block |
| goal_pocket          | 110 x 90 x 32   | hdpe          | Final pocket settling the cube in the goal zone                      |

**Estimated Total Weight**: 870 g
**Estimated Total Cost**: $39.50

## 3. Assembly Strategy

1. Mount `entry_box` on `slide_base` so the jittered cube is captured before it reaches the routed section.
2. Mount the two guide walls and `blocker_bypass_panel` to create a smooth, continuous path around the seeded forbid zone.
3. Mount `goal_pocket` overlapping the seeded goal zone so the cube cannot skate through the target.

## 4. Cost & Weight Budget

| Item                 | Weight (g) | Cost ($) |
| -------------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| slide_base           | 390        | 14.5     |
| entry_box            | 24         | 5.0      |
| guide_wall_left      | 18         | 5.75     |
| guide_wall_right     | 17         | 5.25     |
| blocker_bypass_panel | 16         | 4.5      |
| goal_pocket          | 19         | 4.5      |
| **TOTAL**            | **484**    | **39.5** |

**Budget Margin**: 21% remaining versus the planner target.

## 5. Risk Assessment

| Risk                                             | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cube slides too fast and clips the blocker       | Medium     | High   | Keep the routed path continuous and use a tall bypass panel at the critical corner |
| Cube rebounds out of the goal under low friction | Medium     | Medium | Use a closed goal pocket instead of an open tray                                   |
| Entry jitter sends the cube into a wall edge     | Low        | Medium | Use a wide entry box before the chute narrows                                      |
