## 1. Solution Overview

Use a two-part engineering fixture to exercise the planner handoff and review
boundary.

## 2. Parts List

- Cube body
- Support block

## 3. Assembly Strategy

1. Create the two rigid parts.
2. Position them so the handoff stays deterministic and easy to review.

## 4. Assumption Register

- Assumption: The planner relies on source-backed inputs that must be traceable.

## 5. Detailed Calculations

| ID | Problem / Decision | Result | Impact |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| CALC-001 | Example calculation supporting the plan | `N/A` | Replace this placeholder with the actual derived limit. |

### CALC-001: Example calculation supporting the plan

#### Problem Statement

The plan needs a traceable calculation instead of a freeform claim.

#### Assumptions

- `ASSUMP-001`: The input values are taken from the benchmark or assembly definition.

#### Derivation

- Compute the binding quantity from the declared inputs.

#### Worst-Case Check

- The derived limit must hold under the worst-case allowed inputs.

#### Result

- The design remains valid only if the derived limit is respected.

#### Design Impact

- Update the design or inputs if the calculation changes.

#### Cross-References

- `plan.md#3-assembly-strategy`

## 6. Critical Constraints / Operating Envelope

- Constraint: The mechanism must remain inside the derived operating limits.

## 7. Cost & Weight Budget

- Estimated unit cost: $12
- Estimated weight: 80g

## 8. Risk Assessment

- Keep the geometry simple so the downstream checks remain stable.
