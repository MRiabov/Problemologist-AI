### CALC-001: Example calculation supporting the plan

#### Problem Statement

The plan needs a traceable calculation instead of a freeform claim.

#### Assumptions

- `ASSUMP-001`: The input values are taken from the benchmark or assembly definition.

#### Derivation

- Compute the binding quantity from the declared inputs.

#### Worst-Case Check

- The derived limit must hold under the worst-case allowed inputs.

#### Result

- The design remains valid only if the derived limit is respected.

#### Design Impact

- Update the design or inputs if the calculation changes.

#### Cross-References

- `plan.md#3-assembly-strategy`

## 6. Critical Constraints / Operating Envelope

- Constraint: The mechanism must remain inside the derived operating limits.

## 7. Cost & Weight Budget

- $18.00

## 8. Risk Assessment

- Low.
