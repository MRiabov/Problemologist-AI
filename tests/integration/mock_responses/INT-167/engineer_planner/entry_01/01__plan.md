## 1. Solution Overview

Use a compact proxy-CAD flow that exercises controller-proxied asset serving
without changing the benchmark-owned geometry.

## 2. Parts List

- Proxy CAD asset
- Minimal assembly scaffold

## 3. Assembly Strategy

1. Preserve the benchmark-owned scene.
2. Generate the engineer-owned proxy CAD asset.
3. Keep the solution small and traceable for reviewer evidence.

## 4. Assumption Register

- Assumption: The planner relies on source-backed inputs that must be traceable.

## 5. Detailed Calculations

| ID | Problem / Decision | Result | Impact |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| CALC-001 | Example calculation supporting the plan | `N/A` | Replace this placeholder with the actual derived limit. |

### CALC-001: Example calculation supporting the plan

#### Problem Statement

The plan needs a traceable calculation instead of a freeform claim.

#### Assumptions

- `ASSUMP-001`: The input values are taken from the benchmark or assembly definition.

#### Derivation

- Compute the binding quantity from the declared inputs.

#### Worst-Case Check

- The derived limit must hold under the worst-case allowed inputs.

#### Result

- The design remains valid only if the derived limit is respected.

#### Design Impact

- Update the design or inputs if the calculation changes.

#### Cross-References

- `plan.md#3-assembly-strategy`

## 6. Critical Constraints / Operating Envelope

- Constraint: The mechanism must remain inside the derived operating limits.

## 7. Cost & Weight Budget

- Estimated unit cost: $10
- Estimated weight: 100g

## 8. Risk Assessment

- Asset retrieval or preview wiring may drift from the proxy evidence path.
