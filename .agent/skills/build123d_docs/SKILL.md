# build123d Documentation Reader

Use this skill to quickly reference `build123d` syntax and best practices from the local documentation database.

## Instructions

1. **Locate Reference**: The primary condensed reference is located at `docs/build123d/cheat_sheet.md`.
2. **Search Strategy**:
   - Use `docs/build123d/cheat_sheet.md` for syntax and core concepts.
   - Use `docs/build123d/handpicked.md` for best-practice code patterns.
   - Use `docs/build123d/reference.md` for exhaustive troubleshooting.
3. **Verify Syntax**: Always check the reference before implementing complex boolean operations or selector chains to avoid common pitfalls like context shadowing.
4. **Condensed Knowledge**: This documentation is optimized for LLMs to reduce tokens while maintaining high accuracy of syntax.

### Key Reference Locations

1. **`docs/build123d/cheat_sheet.md`**: Core syntax and selector reference.
2. **`docs/build123d/handpicked.md`**: Practical code snippets (Booleans, Holes, Lofts, etc).
3. **`docs/build123d/reference.md`**: Full introductory examples from official docs.

## Usage Example

"I need to remember the arguments for `PolarLocations`. I will check `docs/build123d/cheat_sheet.md` via `view_file` to verify."
