If I paste a bug request and logs and don't point to a specification in kitty-specs, know that features in the application are thoroughly specified, planned for, and broken down into individual tasks in `kitty-specs/` folder. If you are trying to debug something, you can find a specification that would ideally describe the desired state of the application and technical blueprint on how the application works in one of specifications.
Specifications are generally named well, so you can guess what specification you need to look at from looking at it's folder in `kitty-specs/[spec-number]-[spec-name].

If you didn't guess a spec from the first time, probably want to try again (at least a few times)
