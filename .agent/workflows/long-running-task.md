description: Execute a long-running task
---

Read my input and execute task and think through a solution.

Based on my knowledge, this is a task that can't be executed quickly, for reasons you can probably infer; or I know there is too much work to be done.

I want you do do this: run and iteratively find issues, and improve the result for a specified time - by default 30 minutes.

Check when I sent this message (check `date` command`); then do the first iteration of the output, and when you are done, check`date` again, and if it didn't elapse [my specified time or 30 minutes], check again. Repeat the cycle of improvement, finding new issues and fixing them for the specified time.
