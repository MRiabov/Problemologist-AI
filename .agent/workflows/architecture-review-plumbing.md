description: Review of architectural spec
---

I'm planning out the application. Don't mind the code, it would all be rewritten. Just focus on markdown for now. See file @kitty-specs/desired_architecture.md

Anything that I have yet underspecified for the spec? Scrutinize how the application will be built and where is the leeway.
Focus on the plumbing, not the specification, for it is where we failed the last time.

Don't edit the file - this document will be fully human written; it'll be translated elsewhere.
Just give me the review.
