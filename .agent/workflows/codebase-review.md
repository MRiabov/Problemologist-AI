description: Review codebase for questionable architectural and/or implementation decisions and
---

Review my codebase... any questionable architectural/implementation decisions? decisions that would be challenged? What is not good?
Walk around the codebase and reason around - what's not right. Don't conserve tokens.
Note: we already have made these rounds before - see `docs/code-reviews`; it was successful, but find new issues.

Create issues with naming like `codebase-review-[date]-round-[round #].md`. If there are reviews older then 3 days, move them to `/code-reviews/archive/` (put files at root code-reviews/ folder; also set names like `codebase-review-feb-19-round-1.md`

Also, under each suggestion, leave a **User Review** field. This is for me to fill out if I disagree with any of your suggestions, or to provide comments you'll base on it.

**NEVER** remove my comments thereafter. They will serve other other purposes - to update plans, reviews, etc.
