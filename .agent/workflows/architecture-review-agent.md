description: Review of architectural spec
---

I'm planning out the application. Don't mind the code, it would all be rewritten. Just focus on markdown for now. See file @kitty-specs/desired_architecture.md

Anything that I have yet underspecified for the agentic workflows in the spec? Scrutinize how the agents work, why they work, and what could be missing. For (sub) agents is the expectation not fully defined as compared to the project business  objective?

Don't edit the file - this document will be fully human written; it'll be translated elsewhere.
Just give me the review.
