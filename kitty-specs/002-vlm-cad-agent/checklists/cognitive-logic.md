**Audience**: Author

## Requirement Completeness
- [ ] CHK001 - Are the criteria for the Planner to "Research Docs" vs "Use existing Skills" explicitly defined? [Completeness, Spec §4.1.1]
- [ ] CHK002 - Is the structure of the "Structured Plan" generated by the Planner specified (e.g., JSON, Markdown, list of sub-tasks)? [Gap, Spec §4.1.1]
- [ ] CHK003 - Does the spec define the triggers for the Skill Populator beyond "Terminal Success"? [Completeness, Spec §4.1.4]
- [ ] CHK004 - Are the specific "Visual Feedback" parameters for the Critic defined (e.g., what does it look for in a render)? [Gap, Spec §4.1.3]

## Requirement Clarity
- [ ] CHK005 - Is the term "Consensus" in the Critic node quantified with a specific logic or prompt template? [Ambiguity, Spec §4.1.3]
- [ ] CHK006 - Is "Low-res preview" in user stories quantified with specific resolution or performance constraints? [Clarity, Spec §3.2]
- [ ] CHK007 - Is the distinction between "Inefficient Design" and "Physical Impossibility" defined with measurable thresholds? [Clarity, Spec §2.1.5]

## Graph & Logic Consistency
- [ ] CHK008 - Do the transition rules for the Actor node handle scenarios where it might need to loop back to the Planner *before* a submission? [Consistency, Spec §4.1.2]
- [ ] CHK009 - Is the state-sharing mechanism between the Critic and Planner (for re-planning) explicitly documented? [Consistency, Spec §4.1.3]

## Error Recovery & "Task Impossible"
- [ ] CHK010 - Are the specific requirements for signaling 'HARD_LIMIT_REACHED' defined? [Gap, Spec §4.1.3]
- [ ] CHK011 - Does the spec define the terminal state behavior when "TASK_IMPOSSIBLE" is reached? [Gap, Resilience]
- [ ] CHK012 - Are recovery requirements defined for syntax errors vs. geometric violations? [Completeness, Spec §2.2]
- [ ] CHK013 - Is there a requirement for how the agent should handle a failure to "Update Skill" (e.g., FS permissions/conflicts)? [Gap, Exception Flow]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality
- [ ] CHK014 - Is the "Solver Rate" of >50% tied to specific, version-controlled benchmark sets? [Measurability, Spec §2.2]
- [ ] CHK015 - Is "Skill Growth" measurable beyond file count (e.g., content quality or reuse rate)? [Measurability, Spec §2.2]
