# Fluids integration desired architecture

The system will eventually be expanded with solving of dynamics problems with fluids. Fluids mean both liquids and pneumatics (air)

## Solver

We will move away from MuJoCo for this task and into Genesis-world simulator

## Hardware

(unconfirmed) Chances are we'll need GPUs for higher fidelity simulation of fluids. We will require on-demand with fast cold start GPU provisioning.

## Benchmarks

Yes, benchmarks will need to be created for the simulation.

## Optimization

?
