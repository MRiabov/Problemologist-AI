# Research: Agentic CAD Dashboard Technical Details

## 1. Web Architecture

The dashboard is built as a modern web application with a clear separation between frontend and backend.

### 1.1. Frontend: React + Vite

**Decision**: Use **React** with **Vite** for the UI.
**Rationale**:

- Premium UX with smooth transitions and micro-animations.
- Fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement) for development.
- Rich ecosystem of 3D visualization components (e.g., React Three Fiber).

### 1.2. Backend: FastAPI

**Decision**: Use **FastAPI** on the Controller node.
**Rationale**:

- Native support for Pydantic models (shared with agents).
- Asynchronous by design, suitable for streaming log updates.
- Autogenerated OpenAPI/Swagger documentation.

## 2. 3D Visualization

Instead of `stpyvista`, we use a dedicated 3D viewport component in React.

1. **Protocol**: The backend serves STL/OBJ mesh assets directly from **S3**.
2. **Renderer**: Three.js (via `@react-three/fiber`) handles the 3D rendering in the client browser.
3. **Correlation**: The UI highlights geometric features (violations, goal zones) by mapping face indices returned in the Pydantic reports to the 3D mesh.
