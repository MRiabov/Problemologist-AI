  "source_description": "A streamlit UI for viewing and debugging of agent inputs and outputs. Definitely add support for viewing of 3d models using three js or pyvista. Also, we have features with `trimesh`, so you can use it here too. Should see: 1. Reasoning 2. Agent outputs 3. models that agents generates 4. code that agent generates I think it should be very similar to how Cursor or Claude code or Gemini CLI works; but with 3d viewing support and a UI.",
