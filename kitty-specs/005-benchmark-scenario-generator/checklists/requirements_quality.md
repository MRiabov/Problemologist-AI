# Requirements Quality Checklist: Benchmark Scenario Generator

**Feature**: 005-benchmark-scenario-generator
**Created**: 2025-05-22
**Purpose**: Unit tests for requirements quality (validating completeness, clarity, and consistency of Feature 005 specifications).

## 1. Economic Constraints & Record System Quality

- [x] CHK001 - Are the data types and validation rules for `target_quantity` and `max_unit_cost` explicitly defined in the manifest schema? [Completeness, Spec §3.4 FR-25]
- [x] CHK002 - Is the "Record" system's persistence layer (database vs file) and concurrency strategy specified? [Gap, Spec §3.4 FR-26]
- [x] CHK003 - Is "Beat previous record" quantified? (e.g., does $199.99 beat $200.00, or is there a minimum percentage improvement requirement?) [Clarity, Spec §3.4 FR-27]
- [x] CHK004 - Are requirements defined for how the agent receives the "current record" context (prompt injection vs tool call)? [Completeness, Spec §3.4 FR-27]
- [x] CHK005 - Does the spec define the behavior when a generated scenario has no previous record (cold start)? [Coverage, Gap]
- [x] CHK006 - Is the relationship between production quantity and the cost model (from Spec 004) explicitly linked in the generator requirements? [Consistency]

## 2. Physical Stability & Validation Quality

- [x] CHK007 - Is the 100 m/s velocity threshold [Spec §3.4 FR-13] justified against different scale factors (e.g., does it apply to a 50mm part the same as a 200mm part)? [Clarity]
- [x] CHK008 - Are simulation integration parameters (timestep, integrator type, gravity) specified for the 1-second stability check? [Completeness, Spec §3.4 FR-12]
- [x] CHK009 - Is "Stability" defined beyond max velocity? (e.g., requirements for checking energy conservation or excessive collision penetration depths). [Coverage, Spec §3.4 FR-13]
- [ ] CHK010 - Are requirements specified for "Geometric Checks" beyond manifoldness? (e.g., checks for minimum volume or bounding box intersections with workspace walls). [Completeness, Spec §3.4 FR-11]
- [x] CHK011 - Does the spec define what constitutes a "physically valid" MJCF for Kinematic (Tier 2) scenarios (e.g., joint limit consistency)? [Gap, Spec §3.4 FR-12]

## 3. Promotion & Dataset Management Quality

- [x] CHK012 - Are the criteria for human "Promotion" [Spec §3.8] objectively documented, or is it purely subjective? [Clarity]
- [x] CHK013 - Is there a requirement for "Promoted" scenarios to include a verified "Reference Solution" generated by a baseline agent? [Gap, Spec §3.8]
- [x] CHK014 - Does the spec define the behavior for duplicate scenarios (e.g., if a new generation is geometrically identical to an existing benchmark)? [Edge Case, Gap, Spec §3.8]
- [x] CHK015 - Is the directory structure for Tier-specific benchmarks consistent with the staging directory requirements? [Consistency, Spec §4]
- [x] CHK016 - Are requirements defined for "locking" randomization parameters once a scenario is promoted? [Completeness, Spec §2.1]

## 4. Randomization & Scaling Quality

- [x] CHK017 - Is the interaction between "Random Rescaling" [Spec §3.4 FR-22] and joint/pivot positions explicitly defined? (e.g., do joints scale with the body?) [Clarity, Spec §3.4 FR-24]
- [ ] CHK018 - Are requirements defined for ensuring randomized obstacles do not overlap with the `zone_start` or `zone_goal` areas? [Coverage, Spec §3.3 FR-06]
- [x] CHK019 - Is the "±40% randomization" [Spec §3.3 FR-06] quantified? (e.g., is it 40% of the workspace volume or 40% of the object's initial coordinate value?) [Ambiguity]
- [x] CHK020 - Does the spec define the behavior when directional scaling limits [Spec §3.4 FR-23] conflict with the global workspace "Domain Box"? [Conflict, Gap, Spec §3.4 FR-29]

## 5. Non-Functional & Reliability Quality

- [ ] CHK021 - Is the "5 minute" efficiency target [Spec §5] defined for a specific hardware baseline (CPU/GPU)? [Measurability]
- [ ] CHK022 - Are error handling requirements defined for LLM "hallucination" of non-existent `build123d` APIs? [Coverage, Assumption]
- [ ] CHK023 - Is there a requirement for the generator to be "headless-first" to support CI/CD pipelines? [Completeness, Assumption]
